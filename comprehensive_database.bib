@article{Bertola2022,
	abstract = {Abstract Conservation translocations have become an important management tool, particularly for large wildlife species such as the lion (Panthera leo). When planning translocations, the genetic background of populations needs to be taken into account; failure to do so risks disrupting existing patterns of genetic variation, ultimately leading to genetic homogenization, and thereby reducing resilience and adaptability of the species. We urge wildlife managers to include knowledge of the genetic background of source/target populations, as well as species-wide patterns, in any management intervention. We present a hierarchical decision-making tool in which we list 132 lion populations/lion conservation units and provide information on genetic assignment, uncertainty and suitability for translocation for each source/target combination. By including four levels of suitability, from `first choice' to `no option', we provide managers with a range of options. To illustrate the extent of international trade of lions, and the potential disruption of natural patterns of intraspecific diversity, we mined the CITES Trade Database for estimated trade quantities of live individuals imported into lion range states during the past 4 decades. We identified 1056 recorded individuals with a potential risk of interbreeding with wild lions, 772 being captive-sourced. Scoring each of the records with our decision-making tool illustrates that only 7\% of the translocated individuals were `first choice' and 73\% were `no option'. We acknowledge that other, nongenetic factors are important in the decision-making process, and hence a pragmatic approach is needed. A framework in which source/target populations are scored based on suitability is not only relevant to lion, but also to other species of wildlife that are frequently translocated. We hope that the presented overview supports managers to include genetics in future management decisions and contributes towards conservation of the lion in its full diversity.},

This paper reviews the underlying issues, illustrates application of different types of genetic data analysis to two complex management problems (involving common minke whales and humpback whales), and concludes with a number of recommendations for best practices in the analysis of population genetic data.

@article{Rodrigues2021,
	abstract = {Abstract In long-lived species, although adult survival typically has the highest elasticity, temporal variations in less canalized demographic parameters are the main drivers of population dynamics. Targeting recruitment rates may thus be the most effective strategy to manage these species. We analyzed 1,136 capture--recapture histories collected over 9 years in an isolated population of the critically endangered Lesser Antillean iguana, using a robust design Pradel model to estimate adult survival and recruitment rates. From an adult population size estimated at 928 in 2013, we found a yearly decline of 4\% over the 8-year period. As expected under the canalization hypothesis for a long-lived species, adult survival was high and constant, with little possibility for improvement, whereas the recruitment rate varied over time and likely drove the observed population decline. We then used a prospective perturbation analysis to explore whether managing the species' immature cohorts would at least slow the population decline. The prospective perturbation analysis suggested that a significant and sustained conservation effort would be needed to achieve a recruitment rate high enough to slow the population decline. We posit that the high recruitment rate achieved in 2014---likely due to the maintenance in 2012 of the main nesting sites used by this population---would be sufficient to slow this population's decline if it was sustained each year. Based on the results of diverse pilot studies we conducted, we identified the most likely threats targeting the eggs and immature cohorts, stressing the need to improve reproductive success and survival of immature iguanas. The threats we identified are also involved in the decline of several reptile species, and species from other taxa such as ground-nesting birds. These findings on a little-studied taxon provide further evidence that focusing on the immature life stages of long-lived species can be key to their conservation.},

@article{Link2018,
	abstract = {Abstract N-mixture models provide an appealing alternative to mark--recapture models, in that they allow for estimation of detection probability and population size from count data, without requiring that individual animals be identified. There is, however, a cost to using the N-mixture models: inference is very sensitive to the model's assumptions. We consider the effects of three violations of assumptions that might reasonably be expected in practice: double counting, unmodeled variation in population size over time, and unmodeled variation in detection probability over time. These three examples show that small violations of assumptions can lead to large biases in estimation. The violations of assumptions we consider are not only small qualitatively, but are also small in the sense that they are unlikely to be detected using goodness-of-fit tests. In cases where reliable estimates of population size are needed, we encourage investigators to allocate resources to acquiring additional data, such as recaptures of marked individuals, for estimation of detection probabilities.},

@article{Kolowski2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Counts of independent photo events from camera traps are commonly used to make inference about species occupancy, the density of unmarked populations, and the relative abundance of species across time and space. These applications rest on the untested assumption that data collected from individual cameras are representative of the landscape location in which they are placed, and that nearby cameras would record similar data when any additional micro-site differences are accounted for. We established a high-density camera trapping grid (100 × 100 m; 27 cameras) in Virginia, USA, to explicitly test these assumptions, investigating variation in capture rates and detection probabilities for a range of terrestrial mammals during four 2-month seasonal surveys. Despite controlling for numerous habitat and placement factors, we documented, across all 5 focal species, large ranges and coefficients of variation in both capture rate and detection probabilities, which were similar to those seen across 2 sets of independent forest sampling sites from a larger, more typical camera trap sampling design. We also documented a lack of spatial autocorrelation in capture rate at any distance. Measured local covariates relevant to the camera viewshed (stem density, camera height, log presence, effective detection distance [EDD], total dbh of oak trees) rarely explained any significant portion of observed variation in capture rates or detection probabilities across the grid. The influence of EDD, measured here for the first time for individual camera stations, was inconsistently important and varied in direction of effect depending on species and season. Our study indicates single-camera stations may fail to sample animal presence and frequency of use in a robust and repeatable way, primarily resulting from the influence of both idiosyncrasies in animal movement and measured and unknown micro-site characteristics. We recommend spatial replication within sites (e.g., small-scale shifting of cameras or use of multiple stations) should be considered to minimize impacts of relevant micro-site characteristics, some of which may be difficult to identify.},

	abstract = {Camera-trap studies in the wild record true-positive data, but data loss from false-negatives (i.e. an animal is present but not recorded) is likely to vary and widely impact data quality. Detection probability is defined as the probability of recording an animal if present in the study area. We propose a framework of sequential processes within detection -- a pass, trigger, image registration, and images being of sufficient quality. Using closed-circuit television (CCTV) combined with camera-trap arrays we quantified variation in, and drivers of, these processes for three medium-sized mammal species. We also compared trigger success of wet and dry otter Lutra lutra, as an example of a semiaquatic species. Data loss from failed trigger, failed registration and poor capture quality varied between species, camera-trap model and settings, and were affected by different environmental and animal variables. Distance had a negative effect on trigger probability and a positive effect on registration probability. Faster animals had both reduced trigger and registration probabilities. Close passes (1 m) frequently did not generate triggers, resulting in over 20{\%} data loss for all species. Our results, linked to the framework describing processes, can inform study design to minimize or account for data loss during analysis and interpretation.},

@article{Groombridge2009,
	abstract = {An important requirement for biologists conserving vulnerable species of wildlife and managing genetic problems associated with small population size is to evaluate existing evidence regarding what is known of a species' recent population history. For endemic island species in particular, current genetic impoverishment could be due to either a recent population crash or a consequence of an evolutionary history of sustained isolation and small effective population size. Interpreting any given case can often be further complicated by incomplete or contradictory evidence from historical field surveys that might suggest a very different demographic history. Here, we use the case of the Seychelles kestrel (Falco araea), an island endemic previously listed as critically-endangered but now relatively common, to illustrate how genetic data from microsatellite genotypes of 100--150-year-old museum specimens reveals a recent and severe population crash since the 1940s to approximately eight individuals, before the population recovered. We re-interpret the historical population trajectory of the Seychelles kestrel in the light of the minimal intervention required for this species to recover. We examine different ecological explanations for the decline and apparently unassisted recovery of the Seychelles kestrel, review the evidence for similarly unaided recoveries elsewhere and discuss the implications of unaided population recoveries for future species conservation programmes. Demographic profiles from historical genetic signatures can provide highly informative evidence when evaluating past and future recovery efforts for endangered species.},

@article{Taft2012,
	abstract = {Because of anthropogenic factors many populations have been at least temporarily reduced to a very small population size. Such reductions could potentially decrease genetic variation and increase the probability of extinction. Analysis of molecular markers has shown a decrease in genetic variation but in many cases this has not reduced the ability of the population to recover from the bottleneck. This apparent paradox is resolved by a consideration of how population bottlenecks can affect additive genetic variance, the relevant measure of ability to respond to selective factors. A bottleneck has the potential to increase additive genetic variance in a population. This may result in an increase in fitness, particularly in populations of conservation concern that are small and lack genetic variation. Here we present a meta-analysis of experimental tests of this prediction using models designed to fit data that is strictly additive and data that has non-additive components. This analysis shows that additive genetic variance in a dataset dominated by morphological traits increases, on average, after a bottleneck event when the inbreeding coefficient is less than 0.3, but neither of the theoretical models alone can adequately explain this result. Because of our inability at present to predict the results of a population bottleneck in a specific case and the probability of extinction associated with small population size we caution against using bottlenecks to increase genetic variance, and thus the fitness, of endangered populations.},

@book{Hartl2020,
	abstract = {{A Primer of Population Genetics and Genomics, 4th edition, has been completely revised and updated to provide a concise but comprehensive introduction to the basic concepts of population genetics and genomics. Recent textbooks have tended to focus on such specialized topics as the coalescent, molecular evolution, human population genetics, or genomics. This primer bucks that trend by encouraging a broader familiarity with, and understanding of, population genetics and genomics as a whole. The overview ranges from mating systems through the causes of evolution, molecular population genetics, and the genomics of complex traits. Interwoven are discussions of ancient DNA, gene drive, landscape genetics, identifying risk factors for complex diseases, the genomics of adaptation and speciation, and other active areas of research. The principles are illuminated by numerous examples from a wide variety of animals, plants, microbes, and human populations. The approach also emphasizes learning by doing, which in this case means solving numerical or conceptual problems. The rationale behind this is that the use of concepts in problem-solving lead to deeper understanding and longer knowledge retention. This accessible, introductory textbook is aimed principally at students of various levels and abilities (from senior undergraduate to postgraduate) as well as practising scientists in the fields of population genetics, ecology, evolutionary biology, computational biology, bioinformatics, biostatistics, physics, and mathematics.}},

@article{Templeton1980,
	abstract = {{The founder principle has been used to explain many instances of rapid speciation. Advances from theoretical population genetics are incorporated into MAYR'S original founder-effect genetic-revolution model to yield a newer model called the genetic transilience. The basic theoretical edifice lies upon the fact that founder event can sometimes lead to an accumulation of inbreeding and an induction of gametic disequilibrium. This, in turn, causes alleles to be selected more for their homozygous fitness effects and for their effects on a more stable genetic background. Selection occurring in multi-locus systems controlling integrated developmental, physiological, behavioral, etc., traits is particularly sensitive to these founder effects. If sufficient genetic variability exists in the founder population, such multilocus genetic systems can respond to drift and the altered selective forces by undergoing a rapid shift to a new adaptive peak known as the genetic transilience. A genetic transilience is, therefore, most likely to occur when the founder event causes a rapid accumulation of inbreeding without a severe reduction in genetic variability. The implications of this model are then examined for three aspects of the founder-effect genetic-transilience model: the attributes of the ancestral population, the nature of the sampling process used t o generate the founders and the attributes of the founder population. The model is used to explain several features of the evolution of the Hawaiian Drosophila, and experimental designs are outlined to test the major predictions of the theory. Hence, this theory of speciation can be tested in the laboratory, using systems and techniques that already exist{\^a}€''a rare attribute of most models of speciation.}},

One way of doing this is to estimate the number of alleles expected in samples of specified size, using the rarefaction method applied in ecology. An alternative method, based on extrapolation, consists of adding to the number of alleles actually seen in a population the expected number of alleles missing, given the number of genes examined in the population and the allelic frequencies observed over the whole set of populations. Heterogeneity of allelic richness across populations and across loci can also be tested in this framework by numerical re-sampling. Both methods provide a measure of ``private'' allelic richness, a useful criterion in genetic diversity preservation, by allowing evaluation of the uniqueness of each population in terms of allele numbers. The two methods are compared on isozyme loci in the argan tree of Morocco and on microsatellite genotypes in the European pig. In both species, allelic richness and gene diversity behave quasi-independently over the populations compared and a higher differentiation is observed in allelic richness compared to gene diversity. In general, the rarefaction technique is sensitive to the sample size of reference and may lack sensitivity to rare alleles when the sample size of reference is small. Extrapolation may thus be recommended especially when the sample sizes of the populations are either low on average or highly unbalanced among populations.},

	abstract = {Abstract Most studies of the loss of genetic variation caused by bottlenecks in population size have used heterozygosity as a measure of genetic variation. In this paper, I compare the effects of bottlenecks on the loss of alleles, as well as the reduction in heterozygosity. Population bottlenecks of short duration will have little effect on heterozygosity but are expected to reduce severely the number of alleles present. Heterozygosity provides a good measure of the capability of a population to respond to selection immediately following a bottleneck. However, the number of alleles remaining is important for the long-term response to selection and survival of populations and species.},

@article{DiRienzo1994,
	abstract = {Mutational processes of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in complex genomes are poorly understood. We examined these processes by introducing a two-phase mutation model. In this model, most mutations are single-step changes, but infrequent large jumps in repeat number also occur. We used computer simulations to determine expected values of statistics that reflect frequency distributions of allele size for the two-phase model and two alternatives, the one-step and geometric models. The theoretical expectations for each model were tested by comparison with observed values for 10 SSR loci genotyped in the Sardinian population, whose genetic and demographic histories have been previously reconstructed. The two-phase model provided the best fit to the data for most of these loci in this population. In the analysis we assumed that the loci were neutral and that this population had undergone rapid population growth. Recent observations made for unstable trinucleotide repeats support our suggestion that frequent small changes and rare large changes in repeat number represent two distinct classes of mutation at SSR loci. We genotyped the same 10 loci in Egyptian and sub-Saharan African samples to assess the utility of SSRs for studying the divergence of populations and found that estimates of interpopulation distances from SSRs were similar to those derived from analysis of mitochondrial DNA.},

	abstract = {Abstract Eight individual rock iguanas (Iguana pinguis) from Anegada Island were relocated to Guana Island by Lazell, 1984--1987, in order to establish a second population reservoir for this endangered species. The species may have originally occupied the entire Puerto Rico Bank. The relocation has been successful and, in the area currently providing the best habitat, we estimate a density of 9 or 12 animals of various age classes per 19 ha. The optimal area contains a sheep exclosure with relatively dense understory vegetation and numerous exotic as well as native species of plants. Iguana activity is concentrated on east facing slopes and ridge-tops that get morning sun. Outside the exclosure most edible ground cover and shrubs have been eaten by sheep, leaving toxic or noxious species, such as Croton or Lantana, in the understory where I. pinguis adults generally forage. Removal of sheep may be critical to continued population growth of these reptiles. Views on relocation or repatriation of other endangered Antillean Iguana species are advanced, with some ideas on minimum viable population sizes and a possible explanation for the extirpation of I. pinguis from much of its former range.},

When compared with a study of 1968, the density of the extant population at a 43-ha study site was 0.36/ha, as opposed to 2.03/ha. Leaves represented only 38% of dietary volume, in contrast to 71% in 1968. Fruit comprised 56% of the diet. Well fed individuals of C. pinguis from a relocated population on Guana Island would not eat the leafy components of the Anegada iguanas' diet. Home ranges on Anegada overlapped and were 100 times larger than previously recorded. The sex ratio was two males to one female as opposed to 1:1 in 1968. Iguanas had proportionately lower body mass than animals captured in 1968. Population decline on Anegada seems largely due to increased competition from live stock, managed in 1968 but now feral, eating most palatable vegetation from the understory. Predation by cats and dogs is also a threat. The total remaining population is estimated at <200 individuals. A national park designed to protect the endangered population of C. pinguis has been proposed for Anegada.},

We recaptured hatchlings 5{\^a}€``6 weeks later and measured the direct distance to the release site. Because we treated hatchlings (from eggs to release) randomly with respect to sibship, we eliminated the possibility that any observed sibling similarity in dispersal is merely an artifact of common postnatal influences. To analyze dispersal, we developed a new method that does not make an arbitrary choice of a threshold distance separating dispersers from nondispersers. We found a significant family effect on dispersal. We suspect that this family effect originates from genetic influences rather than from prenatal ones. Indeed, hatchling dispersal was remarkably unrelated to numerous traits (of clutches, mothers, or hatchlings) that might reflect prenatal effects. However, we did find that males were more likely to disperse than females, as predicted for polygynous species. Finally, characteristics of the release site did not appear to influence dispersal.}},

@article{Bonnet1999,
	abstract = {For animal populations in many parts of the world, direct (albeit often accidental) killing by humans may be a significant source of mortality. Many snakes are killed by people (especially by automobiles) every year, but the determinants of a snake's vulnerability to anthropogenic mortality (and thus, patterns of mortality with respect to sex, age and season) are poorly known. We present data on 652 French snakes of six species (Coluber viridiflavus, Elaphe longissima, Natrix maura, N. natrix, Vipera aspis, V. berus) killed either by natural predators, domestic animals or humans (including roadkills). We used information on seasonal patterns of mortality (plus information on population structure from 338 captures of live snakes) to test the hypothesis that snakes are killed mostly when they disperse from their usual home ranges. This hypothesis generates several falsifiable predictions on the expected correlates of mortality rates; most of these predictions are supported by our data. For example, young-of-the-year snakes are killed primarily in the period immediately after hatching (while they disperse); subadults (which are sedentary) generally experience low mortality rates; adult males are killed mainly during the mating season (especially in species where mate-searching males travel widely); and adult females in oviparous species are killed during their egg-laying migrations. Relative to population density, species that use frequent long-distance movements in foraging experience higher mortality than sedentary ambush foragers. In one species (E. longissima), larger males are more at risk. The success of these predictions suggests that movement patterns of snakes may offer valuable indices of their vulnerability to direct anthropogenic mortality.},

@article{Siren2018,
	abstract = {Abstract Individual-based models (IBMs) allow realistic and flexible modelling of ecological systems, but their parameterization with empirical data is statistically and computationally challenging. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has been proposed as an efficient approach for inference with IBMs, but its applicability to data on natural populations has not been yet fully explored. We construct an IBM for the metapopulation dynamics of a species inhabiting a fragmented patch network, and develop an ABC method for parameterization of the model. We consider several scenarios of data availability from count data to combination of mark-recapture and genetic data. We analyse both simulated and real data on white-starred robin (Pogonocichla stellata), a passerine bird living in montane forest environment in Kenya, and assess how the amount and type of data affect the estimates of model parameters and indicators of population state. The indicators of the population state could be reliably estimated using the ABC method, but full parameterization was not achieved due to strong posterior correlations between model parameters. While the combination of the data types did not provide more accurate estimates for most of the indicators of population state or model parameters than the most informative data type (ringing data or genetic data) alone, the combined data allowed robust simultaneous estimation of all unknown quantities. Our results show that ABC methods provide a powerful and flexible technique for parameterizing complex IBMs with multiple data sources, and assessing the dynamics of the population in a robust manner.},

@article{Keenan2018,
	abstract = { Life on Earth comes in many forms, but all life-forms share a common element in carbon. It is the basic building block of biology, and by trapping radiation it also plays an important role in maintaining the Earth's atmosphere at a temperature hospitable to life. Like all matter, carbon can neither be created nor destroyed, but instead is continuously exchanged between ecosystems and the environment through a complex combination of physics and biology. In recent decades, these exchanges have led to an increased accumulation of carbon on the land surface: the terrestrial carbon sink. Over the past 10 years (2007--2016) the sink has removed an estimated 3.61 Pg C year−1 from the atmosphere, which amounts to 33.7\% of total anthropogenic emissions from industrial activity and land-use change. This sink constitutes a valuable ecosystem service, which has significantly slowed the rate of climate change. Here, we review current understanding of the underlying biological processes that govern the terrestrial carbon sink and their dependence on climate, atmospheric composition, and human interventions. },

	abstract = {Assessing species' vulnerability to climate change is a prerequisite for developing effective strategies to conserve them. The last three decades have seen exponential growth in the number of studies evaluating how, how much, why, when, and where species will be impacted by climate change. We provide an overview of the rapidly developing field of climate change vulnerability assessment (CCVA) and describe key concepts, terms, steps and considerations. We stress the importance of identifying the full range of pressures, impacts and their associated mechanisms that species face and using this as a basis for selecting the appropriate assessment approaches for quantifying vulnerability. We outline four CCVA assessment approaches, namely trait-based, correlative, mechanistic and combined approaches and discuss their use. Since any assessment can deliver unreliable or even misleading results when incorrect data and parameters are applied, we discuss finding, selecting, and applying input data and provide examples of open-access resources. Because rare, small-range, and declining-range species are often of particular conservation concern while also posing significant challenges for CCVA, we describe alternative ways to assess them. We also describe how CCVAs can be used to inform IUCN Red List assessments of extinction risk. Finally, we suggest future directions in this field and propose areas where research efforts may be particularly valuable. This article is categorized under: Climate, Ecology, and Conservation > Extinction Risk},

@article{Dawson2011,
	abstract = {Climate change is predicted to become a major threat to biodiversity in the 21st century, but accurate predictions and effective solutions have proved difficult to formulate. Alarming predictions have come from a rather narrow methodological base, but a new, integrated science of climate-change biodiversity assessment is emerging, based on multiple sources and approaches. Drawing on evidence from paleoecological observations, recent phenological and microevolutionary responses, experiments, and computational models, we review the insights that different approaches bring to anticipating and managing the biodiversity consequences of climate change, including the extent of species' natural resilience. We introduce a framework that uses information from different sources to identify vulnerability and to support the design of conservation responses. Although much of the information reviewed is on species, our framework and conclusions are also applicable to ecosystems, habitats, ecological communities, and genetic diversity, whether terrestrial, marine, or fresh water.},

@article{Lugo1999,
	abstract = {Summary Aim Our main goals were to develop a map of the life zones for the conterminous United States, based on the Holdridge Life Zone system, as a tool for ecosystem mapping, and to compare the map of Holdridge life zones with other global vegetation classification and mapping efforts. Location The area of interest is the forty-eight contiguous states of the United States. Methods We wrote a PERL program for determining life zones from climatic data and linked it to the image processing workbench (IPW). The inputs were annual precipitation (Pann), biotemperature (Tbio), sea-level biotemperature (T0bio), and the frost line. The spatial resolution chosen for this study (2.5 arc-minute for classification, 4-km for mapping) was driven by the availability of current state-of-the-art, accurate and reliable precipitation data. We used the Precipitation-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model, or PRISM, output for the contiguous United States downloaded from the Internet. The accepted standard data for air temperature surfaces were obtained from the Vegetation/Ecosystem Modelling and Analysis Project (VEMAP). This data set along with station data obtained from the National Climatic Data Center for the US, were used to develop all temperature surfaces at the same resolution as the Pann. Results The US contains thirty-eight life zones (34\% of the world's life zones and 85\% of the temperate ones) including one boreal, twelve cool temperate, twenty warm temperate, four subtropical, and one tropical. Seventy-four percent of the US falls in the `basal belt', 18\% is montane, 8\% is subalpine, 1\% is alpine, and < 0.1\% is nival. The US ranges from superarid to superhumid, and the humid province is the largest (45\% of the US). The most extensive life zone is the warm temperate moist forest, which covers 23\% of the country. We compared the Holdridge life zone map with output from the BIOME model, Bailey's ecoregions, K{\"u}chler potential vegetation, and land cover, all aggregated to four cover classes. Despite differences in the goals and methods for all these classification systems, there was a very good to excellent agreement among them for forests but poor for grasslands, shrublands, and nonvegetated lands. Main conclusions We consider the life zone approach to have many strengths for ecosystem mapping because it is based on climatic driving factors of ecosystem processes and recognizes ecophysiological responses of plants; it is hierarchical and allows for the use of other mapping criteria at the association and successional levels of analysis; it can be expanded or contracted without losing functional continuity among levels of ecological complexity; it is a relatively simple system based on few empirical data; and it uses objective mapping criteria.},

@article{Ching2011,
	abstract = {A meta-analysis shows that species are shifting their distributions in response to climate change at an accelerating rate. The distributions of many terrestrial organisms are currently shifting in latitude or elevation in response to changing climate. Using a meta-analysis, we estimated that the distributions of species have recently shifted to higher elevations at a median rate of 11.0 meters per decade, and to higher latitudes at a median rate of 16.9 kilometers per decade. These rates are approximately two and three times faster than previously reported. The distances moved by species are greatest in studies showing the highest levels of warming, with average latitudinal shifts being generally sufficient to track temperature changes. However, individual species vary greatly in their rates of change, suggesting that the range shift of each species depends on multiple internal species traits and external drivers of change. Rapid average shifts derive from a wide diversity of responses by individual species.},

@article{Bertolino2021,
	abstract = {Biological invasions are one of the major drivers of global environmental change and there is a need to develop integrated strategies to counteract this phenomenon. Eradication is an effective management option to mitigate the deleterious impacts of invasive alien species (IAS). Eradication can be achieved if all reproductive individuals are removed and population recovery is prevented. However, individuals may survive removal operations in private areas if interventions are not allowed. Here, we present 1) three case studies in which restricted private property access prevented the local eradication of invasive alien populations, and 2) a list of reasons for denying access to private properties and a list of actions implemented or suggested by managers to facilitate access and reported in 29 reviewed papers. The restricted access affected the local eradication of three Eastern grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) populations in Italy. In Lombardy region, in one area a planned eradication did not start and in another area the implemented eradication failed due to the refusal from the owner of a large private property to grant access to managers. In Umbria region, the lack of collaboration from an Italian financial institution produced a delay of 15 months in the removal. In our case studies, therefore, a single person or institution denied access for a personal gain or presumed internal security. The reasons behind landowner opposition may be diverse and individual attitudes towards IAS management will depend on interactions with owners. According to our review, in many cases the denial of access takes place in a general perception of mistrust or opposition to the project as the results of a limited engagement of local people. Such opposition often jeopardizes control activities, with profound negative consequences on eradication, expecially at landscape scale. Bottom-up approaches aiming at involving stakeholders can increase the possibility to achieve IAS eradication, however appropriate legislation remains pivotal to enforce eradication in case of non-cooperative behaviour.},

	abstract = {In North America, nest site competition from invasive cavity-nesting birds can limit the opportunities for successful nesting by native birds. Managing invasive species is costly and complex, requiring input from biologists, decision makers, and the public. An informed and engaged public can play an important role in mitigating the negative effects of invasive avian species. However, little is known regarding the publics' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors toward non-native bird species. We examined the association between participating in a citizen science project and enjoyment, knowledge, and management of two non-native avian species in North America: European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We administered a pre and post survey to 947 people who monitor nest boxes in the United States and Canada, 30% of whom were also reporting their observations to NestWatch, a citizen science project focused on nesting birds. We found that NestWatch participants were more likely to have negative views of non-native species, score higher on bird identification tasks, and manage for invasive species than non-participants. The most important predictor for undertaking management activities was respondents' perceptions of whether they believed non-native birds to be a problem at the continental scale, underscoring the important role of individual factors such as perception. Our study also highlights the important role citizen science may play in shaping attitudes and behaviors and increasing knowledge. We propose a conceptual model describing the mechanisms by which citizen science can be leveraged for management of invasive species.},

For the numerical solution of certain cases an iterative process is described and a short table of a new function is given. The equilibrium states of the various analytical models are considered in relation to the size of the habitat, and questions of stability are investigated.

@article{Hulme2009,
	abstract = {Summary 1 Humans have traded and transported alien species for millennia with two notable step-changes: the end of the Middle Ages and beginning of the Industrial Revolution. However, in recent decades the world has entered a new phase in the magnitude and diversity of biological invasions: the Era of Globalization. This Special Profile reviews the links between the main drivers of globalization and biological invasions and examines state-of-the-art approaches to pathway risk assessment to illustrate new opportunities for managing invasive species. 2 Income growth is a primary driver of globalization and a clear association exists between Gross Domestic Product and the richness of alien floras and faunas for many regions of the world. In many cases, the exposure of these economies to trade is highlighted by the significant role of merchandise imports in biological invasions, especially for island ecosystems. 3 Post-1950, technical and logistic improvements have accelerated the ease with which commodities are transported across the globe and hindered the traceability of goods and the ease of intercepting pests. New sea, land and air links in international trade and human transport have established novel pathways for the spread of alien species. Increasingly, the science advances underpinning invasive species management must move at the speed of commerce. 4 Increasing transport networks and demand for commodities have led to pathway risk assessments becoming the frontline in the prevention of biological invasions. The diverse routes of introduction arising from contaminant, stowaway, corridor and unaided pathways, in both aquatic and terrestrial biomes are complex. Nevertheless, common features enable comparable approaches to risk assessment. By bringing together spatial data on climate suitability, habitat availability and points of entry, as well a demographic models that include species dispersal (both natural and human-mediated) and measures of propagule pressure, it is possible to generate risk maps highlighting potential invasion hotspots that can inform prevention strategies. 5 Synthesis and applications. To date, most attempts to model pathways have focused on describing the likelihood of invader establishment. Few have modelled explicit management strategies such as optimal detection and inspection strategies and assessments of the effectiveness of different management measures. A future focus in these areas will ensure research informs response.},

	abstract = {Abstract: We used historical data to parameterize species-accumulation models relating international trade to the establishment rates of nonindigenous species in the United States over the past century. We then coupled these relationships with published trade forecasts to predict future invasion rates for insects, plant pathogens, and mollusks. Relationships between the accumulation of non-native species and merchandise imports were reasonably described by log-log and log-linear species-area models and Michaelis-Menten accumulation functions. However, the latter two models produced markedly better fits. When coupled with projected trade forecasts, the log-linear species-area model predicted 16--24\% taxon-specific increases in the number of nonindigenous species established in the United States from 2000 to 2020. The Michaelis-Menten model predicted much lower 3--6\% increases, but even this meant 115 new insect species and 5 new plant pathogens. These results suggest that the ecological and economic costs associated with human-caused biological invasions may continue to rise substantially over the coming decades.},

@article{Anderson2014,
	abstract = {Abstract Aim Ecological theory predicts that invasive ecosystem engineers like the American beaver (Castor canadensis) in Tierra del Fuego (TDF) affect landscape-level biodiversity and ecosystem function (BEF) when engineered habitats are novel or extensive. We tested these hypotheses on freshwater BEF, sampling benthic habitat and macroinvertebrates in natural lotic (forest and grassland streams) and natural lentic habitats (bogs, lakes) and beaver-modified lentic ecosystems (active and abandoned ponds). Location Tierra del Fuego Archipelago (Chile and Argentina). Methods To determine effects on patch-scale BEF, we assessed two drivers: substrate diversity (H′) and benthic organic matter standing crop (BOM, g m−2). Extent of impact was estimated as relative stream length (\%) for each patch type in four 1000 ha images. Results The freshwater landscape was 56\% free-flowing streams (natural lotic), 13\% bogs and lakes (natural lentic) and 31\% active and abandoned beaver ponds (beaver lentic). While engineering significantly modified lotic habitats (converting them to ponds), the beaver ponds were largely similar to natural lentic systems, but engineered lentic patches retained more BOM. While benthic biodiversity in beaver ponds was less than streams, the assemblage contained no habitat-specific taxa and was a subset of the natural lentic community. Main conclusions Invasive beavers engineer habitats whose biodiversity is similar to the landscape's natural lentic habitats, but by increasing the surface area and unit area retention of BOM via its impoundments, this invasion augments carbon standing stock approximately 72\% in watersheds. While this invasion is considered the largest alteration to TDF's forested biome in the Holocene, here we discover that its impact is to ecosystem function, rather than biodiversity in the aquatic landscape.},

	abstract = {With increasing urbanization the importance of cities for biodiversity conservation grows. This paper reviews the ways in which biodiversity is affected by urbanization and discusses the consequences of different conservation approaches. Cities can be richer in plant species, including in native species, than rural areas. Alien species can lead to both homogenization and differentiation among urban regions. Urban habitats can harbor self-sustaining populations of rare and endangered native species, but cannot replace the complete functionality of (semi-)natural remnants. While many conservation approaches tend to focus on such relict habitats and native species in urban settings, this paper argues for a paradigm shift towards considering the whole range of urban ecosystems. Although conservation attitudes may be challenged by the novelty of some urban ecosystems, which are often linked to high numbers of nonnative species, it is promising to consider their associated ecosystem services, social benefits, and possible contribution to biodiversity conservation.},

	abstract = {Invasive species, disease vectors, and pathogens affect biodiversity, ecosystem function and services, and human health. Climate change, land use, and transport vectors interact in complex ways to determine the spread of native and non-native invasive species, pathogens, and their effects on ecosystem dynamics. Early detection and in-depth understanding of invasive species and infectious diseases will require an integrated network of research platforms and information exchange to identify hotspots of invasion or disease emergence. Partnerships with state and federal agencies that monitor the spread and impacts of invasive species and pathogens will be critical in developing a national data and research network that can facilitate a full understanding of the resulting effects on ecosystems and society. Citizen science can also play a role; individuals can report new invasions, record phenological changes associated with invasions or disease outbreaks, and can participate in efforts such as the Breeding Bird Survey, which may reveal long-term biotic change following species invasions and disease spread. The ecological and societal impacts of invasive species and pathogens differ across gradients of climate and land use, and in the presence of global climate change may exacerbate both their propagation and impacts. Understanding the interactions of invasive species, disease vectors, and pathogens with other drivers of ecosystem change is critical to human health and economic well-being.},

Vortex is among the leading population modelling software and the latest release includes an automated sensitivity test module. However, an equivalent automation of the post-simulation data inspection and analysis is currently missing. vortexR is an R package to automate the analysis and visualisation of outputs from the population viability modelling software Vortex. vortexR facilitates collating Vortex output files, data visualisation and basic analyses (e.g. pairwise comparisons of scenarios), as well as providing more advanced statistics, such as searching for the best regression model(s) from a list of predictors to investigate the main effect and the interaction effects of the variables of interest. This package speeds up and greatly facilitates the reproducibility and portability of post-simulation analysis results.},

@article{Hernandez2013,
	abstract = {Population viability analysis (PVA) has become a basic tool of current conservation practice. However, if not accounted for properly, the uncertainties inherent to PVA predictions can decrease the reliability of this type of analysis. In the present study, we performed a PVA of the whole western European population (France, Portugal, and Spain) of the endangered Bonelli's Eagle (Aquila fasciata), in which we thoroughly explored the consequences of uncertainty in population processes and parameters on PVA predictions. First, we estimated key vital rates (survival, fertility, recruitment, and dispersal rates) using monitoring, ringing, and bibliographic data from the period 1990--2009 from 12 populations found throughout the studied geographic range. Second, we evaluated the uncertainty about model structure (i.e., the assumed processes that govern individual fates and population dynamics) by comparing the observed growth rates of the studied populations with model predictions for the same period. Third, using the model structures suggested in the previous step, we assessed the viability of both the local populations and the overall population. Finally, we analyzed the effects of model and parameter uncertainty on PVA predictions. Our results strongly support the idea that all local populations in western Europe belong to a single, spatially structured population operating as a source--sink system, whereby the populations in the south of the Iberian Peninsula act as sources and, thanks to dispersal, sustain all other local populations, which would otherwise decline. Predictions regarding population dynamics varied considerably, and models assuming more constrained dispersal predicted more pessimistic population trends than models assuming greater dispersal. Model predictions accounting for parameter uncertainty revealed a marked increase in the risk of population declines over the next 50 years. Sensitivity analyses indicated that adult and pre-adult survival are the chief vital rates regulating these populations, and thus, the conservation efforts aimed at improving these survival rates should be strengthened in order to guarantee the long-term viability of the European populations of this endangered species. Overall, the study provides a framework for the implementation of multi-site PVAs and highlights the importance of dispersal processes in shaping the population dynamics of long-lived birds distributed across heterogeneous landscapes.},

The suitability of and long-term species survival from such programs remain largely untested, however. We measured lifetime reproductive success of the first two generations of steelhead trout that were reared in captivity and bred in the wild after they were released. By reconstructing a three-generation pedigree with microsatellite markers, we show that genetic effects of domestication reduce subsequent reproductive capabilities by ∼40\% per captive-reared generation when fish are moved to natural environments. These results suggest that even a few generations of domestication may have negative effects on natural reproduction in the wild and that the repeated use of captive-reared parents to supplement wild populations should be carefully reconsidered.},

@article{Fredrickson2006,
	abstract = {Abstract:  Hybridization and introgression are significant causes of endangerment in many taxa and are considered the greatest biological threats to the reintroduced population of red wolves (Canis rufus) in North Carolina (U.S.A.). Little is known, however, about these processes in red wolves and coyotes (C. latrans). We used individual-based simulations to examine the process of hybridization and introgression between these species. Under the range of circumstances we considered, red wolves in colonizing and established populations were quickly extirpated, persisted near the carrying capacity, or had intermediate outcomes. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the probabilities of quasi extinction and persistence of red wolves near the carrying capacity were most affected by the strength of two reproductive barriers: red wolf challenges and assortative mating between red wolves and coyotes. Because model parameters for these barriers may be difficult to estimate, we also sought to identify other predictors of red wolf population fate. The proportion of pure red wolves in the population was a strong predictor of the future probabilities of red wolf quasi extinction and persistence. Finally, we examined whether sterilization can be effective in minimizing introgression while allowing the reintroduced red wolf population to grow. Our results suggest sterilization can be an effective short-term strategy to reduce the likelihood of extirpation in colonizing populations of red wolves. Whether red wolf numbers are increased by sterilization depends on the level of sterilization effort and the acting reproductive barriers. Our results provide an outline of the conditions likely required for successful reestablishment and long-term maintenance of populations of wild red wolves in the presence of coyotes. Our modeling approach may prove generally useful in providing insight into situations involving complex species interactions when data are few.},

All three species have low levels of genetic variation, comparable to or lower than those generally reported for rare plants with restricted geographic ranges. Liatris ohlingerae has more than twice the expected heterozygosity of the other two species, with little population differentiation. In contrast, Hypericum cumulicola has highly differentiated populations with little apparent interpopulation gene flow and heterozygote deficiencies indicative of inbreeding. Eryngium cuneifolium, the species with the narrowest range and fewest populations, has intermediate values for genetic parameters. Although the three species have narrow and overlapping geographic ranges and similar habitat specificity, we discuss how optimal conservation of each species differs.},

	abstract = {Abstract This study examines the population genetic structure of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) across India, which harbours over half the world's population of this endangered species. Mitochondrial DNA control region sequences and allele frequencies at six nuclear DNA microsatellite markers obtained from the dung of free-ranging elephants reveal low mtDNA and typical microsatellite diversity. Both known divergent clades of mtDNA haplotypes in the Asian elephant are present in India, with southern and central India exhibiting exclusively the β clade of Fernando et al. (2000), northern India exhibiting exclusively the α clade and northeastern India exhibiting both, but predominantly the α clade. A nested clade analysis revealed isolation by distance as the principal mechanism responsible for the observed haplotype distributions within the α and β clades. Analyses of molecular variance and pairwise population FST tests based on both mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA suggest that northern-northeastern India, central India, Nilgiris (in southern India) and Anamalai-Periyar (in southern India) are four demographically autonomous population units and should be managed separately. In addition, evidence for female philopatry, male-mediated gene flow and two possible historical biogeographical barriers is described.},

	abstract = {Hybridization between taxonomically similar species is an often-overlooked mechanism limiting the recovery of threatened and endangered species. We present molecular genetic data for the first time demonstrating that Canada lynx and bobcats hybridize in the wild. We verify that two microsatellite loci Lc106 and Lc110 have non-overlapping allele ranges between Canada lynx and bobcats, and that three putative lynx from Minnesota contain DNA from both bobcats and lynx. Additionally, we use a published test for the 16S rRNA region of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to determine the maternal species; all hybrids had lynx mothers. Fifteen per cent (3/20) of our `putative lynx' samples were hybrids, although these data are not from a representative sampling effort. Hybridization may be an under-appreciated factor limiting the distribution and recovery of lynx. The presence of hybrids is thus a new factor in the population management of both species with potential implications for hunting and trapping of bobcats.},

	abstract = {Cichlid fish species of Lake Victoria can interbreed without loss of fertility but are sexually isolated by mate choice. Mate choice is determined on the basis of coloration, and strong assortative mating can quickly lead to sexual isolation of color morphs. Dull fish coloration, few color morphs, and low species diversity are found in areas that have become turbid as a result of recent eutrophication. By constraining color vision, turbidity interferes with mate choice, relaxes sexual selection, and blocks the mechanism of reproductive isolation. In this way, human activities that increase turbidity destroy both the mechanism of diversification and that which maintains diversity.},

@article{Lacy1987,
	abstract = {Abstract: A computer simulation program was used to examine interacting effects of genetic drift, mutation, immigration from outside populations, directional and balancing selection, and population subdivision on the loss of genetic variability from small, managed populations. Stochastic ewnts were simulated with a pseudo-random number generator, and the genetic variation (expected heterozygosity) witbin and between populations was monitored in 25 populations for 100 generations. Genetic drift was the overriding factor controling the loss of genetic variation Mutation has no noticeable effect on populations of the size typically managed in zoos and nature preserves Immigration from a large source population can strikingly slow, halt, or even reverse the loss of genetic variation, even with only one or a few migrants per generation. Unless selection is stronger than commonly observed in natural populations, it is inefficient in countering drift when population sizes are on the order of 100 or fewer. Subdivided populations rapidly lose variability from within each sub-population but retain variation across the subpopulations better than does a panmictic population. These results suggest that population managers should be concerned with the variation-depleting effects of genetic drift, perhaps almost to the exclusion of consideration of selection and mutation Drift can be countered by the introduction of vety occasional immigrants or, less effectively, by division of the managed population into smaller breeding groups that interchange enough migrants to prevent unacceptably deleterious inbreeding within each subpopulation},

@article{Lacy1996,
	abstract = {The severity of inbreeding depression appears to vary among taxa, but few ecological or other patterns have been identified that predict accurately which taxa are most sensitive to inbreeding. To examine the causes of heterogeneity in inbreeding depression, the effects of inbreeding on reproduction, survival, and growth were measured in three replicate experimental stocks for each of three subspecies of Peromyscus polionotus mice. Inbreeding of the dam reduced the probability of breeding, the probability of producing a second litter, and litter size. Inbreeding of the litter caused depression of litter size, juvenile viability, and mass at weaning, and caused an increase in the within-litter variance in mass. In spite of differences between the subspecies in natural population sizes, genetic variation, and mean rates of reproduction and survival, all variation observed between experimental populations in their responses to inbreeding could be attributed to random founder effects. The genetic load of deleterious alleles in each replicate was unequally partitioned among its founder pairs, and different founders contributed to the load affecting different fitness components. Thus, inbreeding depression for any one fitness component, in our experimental environment, must be due to relatively few deleterious alleles with major effects. Genetic loads so comprised would be expected to diverge among natural populations due to both random drift and selective removal of recessive deleterious alleles during population bottlenecks. The near universality of inbreeding depression would be maintained, however, if different alleles contribute to inbreeding depression of different fitness components and in different environments.},

@article{Eldridge1999,
	abstract = {Abstract: It has been argued that demographic and environmental factors will cause small, isolated populations to become extinct before genetic factors have a significant negative impact. Islands provide an ideal opportunity to test this hypothesis because they often support small, isolated populations that are highly vulnerable to extinction. To assess the potential negative impact of isolation and small population size, we compared levels of genetic variation and fitness in island and mainland populations of the black-footed rock-wallaby (Petrogale lateralis[Marsupialia: Macropodidae]). Our results indicate that the Barrow Island population of P. lateralis has unprecedented low levels of genetic variation ( He= 0.053, from 10 microsatellite loci) and suffers from inbreeding depression (reduced female fecundity, skewed sex ratio, increased levels of fluctuating asymmetry). Despite a long period of isolation (∼1600 generations) and small effective population size ( Ne∼15), demographic and environmental factors have not yet driven this population to extinction. Nevertheless, it has been affected significantly by genetic factors. It has lost most of its genetic variation and become highly inbred ( Fe= 0.91), and it exhibits reduced fitness. Because several other island populations of P. lateralis also exhibit exceptionally low levels of genetic variation, this phenomenon may be widespread. Inbreeding in these populations is at a level associated with high rates of extinction in populations of domestic and laboratory species. Genetic factors cannot then be excluded as contributing to the extinction proneness of small, isolated populations.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter reviews and analyzes the spread of the metapopulation concept to conservation biology and applications. The metapopulation concept has now been firmly established in population biology. Two key premises in this approach to population biology are that populations are spatially structured into assemblages of local breeding populations, and that migration among the local populations has some effect on local dynamics, including the possibility of population reestablishment following extinction. These premises contrast with those of standard models of demography, population growth, genetics, and community interaction that assume a panmictic population structure, with all individuals equally likely to interact with any others. The focus on metapopulations, combined with that on genetics, has led to the population and the species becoming the dominant levels of concern in conservation. It is striking that the recent explosion of interest in ecosystem management is quite antithetic to a primary interest in populations and to single species management. Ecosystem management and metapopulation models share a concern with landscapes and regions, rather than highly local settings, and one could imagine a landscape with a distribution of habitat patches that would maintain many metapopulations simultaneously.},

@article{Thatte2018,
	abstract = {Habitat loss is the greatest threat to large carnivores around the world. Maintenance of functional connectivity in fragmented landscapes is important for long-term species persistence. Here, we merge landscape genetics analyses and spatially-explicit simulations to understand future persistence and extinction of tigers (Panthera tigris) in Central India. Tigers in this landscape are restricted to Protected Areas (PAs) and forest fragments embedded within a mosaic of agricultural fields and human settlements. We examined current population connectivity of tigers across nine reserves (using 116 non-invasively sampled individuals and 12 microsatellites). Genetic data was used to infer resistance-to-movement. Our results suggest that dense human settlements and roads with high traffic are detrimental to tiger movement. We used landscape genetic simulations to model 86 different scenarios that incorporated impacts of future land-use change on inferred population connectivity and extinction. Our results confirm that genetic variability (heterozygosity) will decrease in the future and small and/or isolated PAs will have a high risk of local extinction. The average extinction risk of small PAs will reduce by 23--70% if a 5km buffer is added around existing boundaries. Unplanned development will result in 35% lower heterozygosity and 56% higher average extinction probability for tigers within protected areas. Increasing tiger numbers in such a scenario will decrease extinction probability just by 12% (from 56% to 44%). Scenarios where habitat connectivity was enhanced and maintained, stepping-stone populations were introduced/maintained, and tiger numbers were increased, led to low overall extinction probability (between 3 and 21%). Our simulations provide a means to quantitatively evaluate the effects of different land-use change scenarios on connectivity and extinction, linking basic science to land-use change policy and planned infrastructure development.},

@article{Forbes1999,
	abstract = {Abstract Use of a new class of molecular marker for evolutionary or conservation studies may promise improved information, but it may also call for reassessment of analytical methods and empirical limitations. We used DNA microsatellites to study population structure in Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis canadensis) and to test the ability of microsatellites to distinguish bighorn subspecies. Genetic differentiation between bighorn populations was dramatically greater than in comparable studies of brown bears and grey wolves, and these species differences are consistent with known differences in habitat use and dispersal. In bighorn, however, statistical limitations make it difficult to distinguish between moderately and highly divergent populations. As a result, only gene flow estimates greater than about one migrant per generation (OMPG) are informative about true population relatedness. In bears and wolves, apparent differentiation is so low that migration estimates are greater than OMPG continent-wide, but factors other than high gene flow may contribute to these patterns. Despite analytical difficulties at large geographical scales and large genetic divergences, microsatellite data assist management by characterizing historical rates and patterns of dispersal on smaller scales, and by detecting population bottlenecks and regions of particularly high or low historical gene flow.},

@article{Donald2007,
	abstract = {Offspring sex ratios in wild bird populations, and the extent to which they vary from the equality expected by random genotypic sex determination, have received much recent attention. Adult sex ratios (ASRs) in wild birds, on the other hand, remain very poorly described, and many of the questions about them posed by Ernst Mayr in 1939 remain unanswered. This review assesses population-level sex ratio patterns in wild bird populations, with an emphasis on the ASR. A quantitative assessment of over 200 published estimates of ASR, covering species from a wide range of taxa, regions and habitats, supported Mayr's assertion that skewed ASRs are common in wild bird populations. On average, males outnumbered females by around 33\%, and 65\% of published estimates differed significantly from equality. In contrast, population-level estimates of offspring sex ratio in birds did not generally differ from equality, and mean ASR across a range of wild mammal species was strongly female-skewed. ASR distortion in birds was significantly more severe in populations of globally threatened species than in non-threatened species, a previously undescribed pattern that has profound implications for their monitoring and conservation. Higher female mortality, rather than skewed offspring sex ratio, is the main driver of male-skewed ASRs in birds, and the causes and implications of this are reviewed. While estimates of ASR in wild bird populations may be subject to a number of biases, which are discussed, there is currently no quantitative evidence that an ASR of one male to one female represents the norm in birds. A better understanding and reporting of ASRs in wild bird populations could contribute greatly to our understanding of population processes and could contribute much to theoretical and applied research and conservation.},

	abstract = {The genus Cyclura includes nine extant species and six subspecies of West Indian Rock Iguanas and is one of the most imperiled genera of squamate reptiles globally. An understanding of species diversity, evolutionary relationships, diversification, and historical biogeography in this group is crucial for implementing sound long-term conservation strategies. We collected DNA samples from 1 to 10 individuals per taxon from all Cyclura taxa (n = 70 ingroup individuals), focusing where possible on incorporating individuals from different populations of each species. We also collected 1--2 individuals from each of seven outgroup species of iguanas (Iguana delicatissima; five Ctenosaura species) and Anolis sagrei (n = 12 total outgroup individuals). We used targeted genomic sequence capture to isolate and to sequence 1,872 loci comprising of 687,308 base pairs (bp) from each of the 82 individuals from across the nuclear genome. We extracted mitochondrial reads and assembled and annotated mitogenomes for all Cyclura taxa plus outgroup species. We present well-supported phylogenomic gene tree/species tree analyses for all extant species of Cyclura using ASTRAL-III, SVDQuartets, and StarBEAST2 methods, and discuss the taxonomic, biogeographic, and conservation implications of these data. We find a most recent common ancestor of the genus 9.91 million years ago. The earliest divergence within Cyclura separates C. pinguis from a clade comprising all other Cyclura. Within the latter group, a clade comprising C. carinata from the southern Lucayan Islands and C. ricordii from Hispaniola is the sister taxon to a clade comprising the other Cyclura. Among the other Cyclura, the species C. cornuta and C. stejnegeri (from Hispaniola and Isla Mona) form the sister taxon to a clade of species from Jamaica (C. collei), Cuba and Cayman Islands (C. nubila and C. lewisi), and the eastern (C. rileyi) and western (C. cychlura) Lucayan Islands. Cyclura cychlura and C. rileyi form a clade whose sister taxa are C. nubila and C. lewisi. Cyclura collei is the sister taxon to these four species combined.},

	abstract = {{Three subspecies of Northern Bahamian Rock Iguanas, Cyclura cychlura, are currently recognized: C. c. cychlura, restricted to Andros Island, and C. c. figginsi and C. c. inornata, native to the Exuma Island chain. Populations on Andros are genetically distinct from Exuma Island populations, yet genetic divergence among populations in the Exumas is inconsistent with the 2 currently recognized subspecies from those islands. The potential consequences of this discrepancy might include the recognition of a single subspecies throughout the Exumas rather than 2. That inference also ignores evidence that populations of C. cychlura are potentially adaptively divergent. We compared patterns of population relatedness in a three-tiered host-parasite system: C. cychlura iguanas, their ticks (genus Amblyomma, preferentially parasitizing these reptiles), and Rickettsia spp. endosymbionts (within tick ectoparasites). Our results indicate that while C. c. cychlura on Andros is consistently supported as a separate clade, patterns of relatedness among populations of C. c. figginsi and C. c. inornata within the Exuma Island chain are more complex. The distribution of the hosts, different tick species, and Rickettsia spp., supports the evolutionary independence of C. c. inornata. Further, these patterns are also consistent with two independent evolutionarily significant units within C. c. figginsi. Our findings suggest coevolutionary relationships between the reptile hosts, their ectoparasites, and rickettsial organisms, suggesting local adaptation. This work also speaks to the limitations of using neutral molecular markers from a single focal taxon as the sole currency for recognizing evolutionary novelty in populations of endangered species.}},

However, correcting for Family-Wise Error Rates (FWER) that are inflated due to multiple comparisons, is sparingly reported in our current literature. In this issue of Molecular Ecology Resources, perform a meta-analysis of 215 population genetics studies published between 2011 and 2013 to show (i) scarce use of FWER corrections across all three classes of tests, and (ii) when used, inconsistent application of correction methods with a clear bias towards less-conservative corrections for tests of population differentiation, than for tests of HWE, and LD. Here we replicate this meta-analysis using 205 population genetics studies published between 2013 and 2018, to show the same continued disuse, and inconsistencies. We hope that both studies serve as a wake-up call to population geneticists, reviewers, and editors to be rigorous about consistently correcting for FWER inflation.},

	abstract = {Summary Community genetics was originally proposed as a novel approach to identifying links between genes and ecosystems, and merging ecological and evolutional perspectives. The dozen years since the birth of community genetics have seen many empirical studies and common garden experiments, as well as the rise of eco-evolutionary dynamics research and a general shift in ecology to incorporate intraspecific variation. So what have we learned from community genetics? Can individual genes affect entire ecosystems? Are there interesting questions left to be answered, or has community genetics run its course? This perspective makes a series of key points about the general patterns that have emerged and calls attention to gaps in our understanding to be addressed in the coming years. Contents Summary 65 I.

@article{VaneWright1991,
	abstract = {Politicians and scientists alike now agree that a priority list of global centres for preservationof biological diversity is required. Diversity has generally been measured only in terms of species richness, or in the form of indices combining richness with abundance. Such measures are considered inadequate for the task in hand. A novel index, based on the information content of cladistic classifications and giving a measure of taxonomic distinctness, is introduced. This taxic diversity measure, when coupled with detailed knowledge of distribution, can be used in modified analyses of the type previously developed as `critical faunas analysis' or `network analysis'. Central to all such analyses is the concept of complementarity of floras or faunas. By employing complementariry, step-wise procedures can identify optimally efficient, single-site sequences of priority areas for a group, taking existing reserves into account or not, as required. For practical planning it is concluded that two basic rounds of analysis are required: first, recognition of global priority areas by taxic diversity techniques; secondly, within any such area, analysis without taxic weighting (as being developed by Margules and his co-workers) to identify a network of reserves to contain all local taxa and ecosystems. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of some immediate prospects for development of a systematic approach to global conservation evaluation.},

	abstract = {Summary
Extreme events have profound ecological impacts on species and ecosystems, including range contractions and collapse of entire ecosystems. Although theory predicts that extreme events cause loss of genetic diversity, empirical demonstrations are rare, obscuring implications for future adaptive capacity of species and populations. Here, we use rare genetic data from before an extreme event to empirically demonstrate massive and cryptic loss of genetic diversity across ∼800 km of underwater forests following the most severe marine heatwave on record. Two forest-forming seaweeds (Sargassum fallax and Scytothalia dorycarpa) lost ∼30%--65% of average genetic diversity within the 800-km footprint of the heatwave and up to 100% of diversity at some sites. Populations became dominated by single haplotypes that were often not dominant or present prior to the heatwave. Strikingly, these impacts were cryptic and not reflected in measures of forest cover used to determine ecological impact of the heatwave. Our results show that marine heatwaves can drive strong loss of genetic diversity, which may compromise adaptability to future climatic change.},

Genetic estimators of both NC and Ne are increasingly widely used because molecular markers are increasingly available, statistical methods are improving rapidly, and genetic estimators complement or improve upon traditional demographic estimators. We review the kinds and applications of estimators of both NC and Ne, and the often undervalued and misunderstood ratio of effective-to-census size (Ne/NC). We focus on recently improved and well evaluated methods that are most likely to facilitate conservation. Finally, we outline areas of future research to improve Ne and NC estimation in wild populations.},

@article{Chisholm2018,
	abstract = {To estimate species loss from habitat destruction, ecologists typically use species-area relationships, but this approach neglects the spatial pattern of habitat fragmentation. Here, we provide new, easily applied, analytical methods that place upper and lower bounds on immediate species loss at any spatial scale and for any spatial pattern of habitat loss. Our formulas are expressed in terms of what we name the 'Preston function', which describes triphasic species-area relationships for contiguous regions. We apply our method to case studies of deforestation and tropical tree species loss at three different scales: a 50 ha forest plot in Panama, the tropical city-state of Singapore and the Brazilian Amazon. Our results show that immediate species loss is somewhat insensitive to fragmentation pattern at small scales but highly sensitive at larger scales: predicted species loss in the Amazon varies by a factor of 16 across different spatial structures of habitat loss.},

@article{Servais2010,
	abstract = {The `Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event' (GOBE) saw a spectacular increase in marine biodiversity at all taxonomic levels largely within the phyla established much earlier during the so-called `Cambrian Explosion'. The diversification was probably the result of a combination of several geological and biological processes and the positive feedbacks resulting from them. The present paper reviews the palaeoecological dimension of the GOBE. It involved major increases in α, {\ss} and γ biodiversity largely associated with the rise of the Paleozoic Evolutionary Fauna dominated by suspension feeders and involving a greater occupation of ecospace and more complex ecological structures in the Ecological Evolutionary Units P1 and P2. In the benthos, these include more complex food webs than those of the Cambrian, greater tiering, especially above the sediment--water interface, and the development of guild structures indicating increased competition between taxa for particular resources. The Ordovician is characterized by a profound change in reef composition, with a switch from microbial-dominated reefs in the Early and Middle Ordovician to metazoan-dominated reefs in the Late Ordovician. Increases in complexity of deep-water trace fossil assemblages began in the Early Ordovician and mark the increasing exploitation in that environment and the development of hardgrounds permitted bioerosion and encrusting strategies together with the appearance of cryptic communities. Within the water column, the GOBE involved a significant increase in the diversity of the phytoplankton and the development of a diverse zooplankton (including planktotrophic larvae from a range of invertebrate clades). This revolution in the plankton enabled the establishment of a diverse fauna of pelagic vertebrates, molluscs and arthropods and promoted the rise of suspension feeders in the benthos. An escalation amongst predators and thus community evolution may also have been a major driver of biodiversification.},

	abstract = {{Habitat destruction has driven much of the current biodiversity extinction crisis, and it compromises the essential benefits, or ecosystem services, that humans derive from functioning ecosystems. Securing both species and ecosystem services might be accomplished with common solutions. Yet it is unknown whether these two major conservation objectives coincide broadly enough worldwide to enable global strategies for both goals to gain synergy. In this article, we assess the concordance between these two objectives, explore how the concordance varies across different regions, and examine the global potential for safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystem services simultaneously. We find that published global priority maps for biodiversity conservation harbor a disproportionate share of estimated terrestrial ecosystem service value (ESV). Overlap of biodiversity priorities and ESV varies among regions, and in areas that have high biodiversity priority but low ESV, specialized conservation approaches are necessary. Overall, however, our findings suggest opportunities for safeguarding both biodiversity and ecosystem services. Sensitivity analyses indicate that results are robust to known limitations of available ESV data. Capitalizing on these opportunities will require the identification of synergies at fine scales, and the development of economic and policy tools to exploit them.}},

@article{Freudenberger2013,
	abstract = {The limited resources available for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services call for prioritisation schemes. For instance, in the process of systematic conservation planning site selection is partly determined by efficiency gains. In this paper we present an alternative method for global spatial priority-setting based on ecological indicators, combined with social and economic conditions that influence the effectiveness of conservation, and measures for the long-term persistence of biodiversity. In the analysis the assumption made is that nature conservation should prioritize the effective maintenance of functional ecosystems that do not only provide the most ecosystem services but are also more likely to have a high adaptive capacity towards unavoidable environmental change. Furthermore, the effectiveness and permanence of conservation projects is tied to certain socioeconomic and political conditions that, as we suggest, should be evaluated as part of the conservation priority-setting process. We propose three new priority categories: eco-functionally wise (EcoWise), socioeconomically wise (SocioWise) and proactive allocation of conservation resources considering future climate change (ClimateWise) expressed as indices based on 16 different indicators. Analysing the combined effects of these three categories (EcoSocioClimateWise), in a spatially explicit way highlights the importance of tropical, subtropical but also some temperate and boreal forest areas all of which are characterized by high values of vegetation density, tree height and carbon storage. Our recommendations for policy makers prompt a shift in conservation planning towards advocating the use of ecological and socioeconomic indicators in combination with proxies for the vulnerability to future climate change impacts.},

@article{Hausdorf2011,
	abstract = {New insights in the speciation process and the nature of ``species'' that accumulated in the past decade demand adjustments of the species concept. The standing of some of the most broadly accepted or most innovative species concepts in the light of the growing evidence that reproductive barriers are semipermeable to gene flow, that species can differentiate despite ongoing interbreeding, that a single species can originate polyphyletically by parallel evolution, and that uniparental organisms are organised in units that resemble species of biparental organisms is discussed. As a synthesis of ideas in existing concepts and the new insights, a generalization of the genic concept is proposed that defines species as groups of individuals that are reciprocally characterized by features that would have negative fitness effects in other groups and that cannot be regularly exchanged between groups upon contact. The benefits of this differential fitness species concept are that it classifies groups that keep differentiated and keep on differentiating despite interbreeding as species, that it is not restricted to specific mutations or mechanisms causing speciation, and that it can be applied to the whole spectrum of organisms from uni- to biparentals.},

@article{Wiley1978,
	abstract = {{$[$}The concept of species (as taxa) adopted by an investigator will influence his perception of the processes by which species originate. The concept adopted should have as universal applicability as current knowledge permits. Simpson's definition of a species is modified to state: a species is a lineage of ancestral descendant populations which maintains its identity from other such lineages and which has its own evolutionary tendencies and historical fate. This definition is defended as that which has widest applicability given current knowledge of evolutionary processes. Four corollaries are deduced and discussed relative to other species concepts: (1) all organisms, past and present, belong to some evolutionary species; (2) reproductive isolation must be effective enough to permit maintenance of identity from other contemporary lineages; (3) morphological distinctiveness is not necessary; and (4) no presumed (hypothesized) single lineage may be subdivided into a series of ancestral-descendant "species." The application of the evolutionary species concept to allopatric demes and to asexual species is discussed and it is concluded that the lack of evolutionary divergence forms the basis for grouping such populations into single species. It is suggested that some ecological species definitions lead to under-estimations of the rate of extinction due to interspecific competition because their logical framework excludes unsuccessful species from being species. Finally, the implications of accepting an evolutionary species concept to the field of phylogeny reconstruction are discussed.{$]$}},

	abstract = {Understanding human impact on biodiversity depends on sound quantitative projection. Pereira et al. (p. 1496, published online 26 October) review quantitative scenarios that have been developed for four main areas of concern: species extinctions, species abundances and community structure, habitat loss and degradation, and shifts in the distribution of species and biomes. Declines in biodiversity are projected for the whole of the 21st century in all scenarios, but with a wide range of variation. Hoffmann et al. (p. 1503, published online 26 October) draw on the results of five decades' worth of data collection, managed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature Species Survival Commission. A comprehensive synthesis of the conservation status of the world's vertebrates, based on an analysis of 25,780 species (approximately half of total vertebrate diversity), is presented: Approximately 20\% of all vertebrate species are at risk of extinction in the wild, and 11\% of threatened birds and 17\% of threatened mammals have moved closer to extinction over time. Despite these trends, overall declines would have been significantly worse in the absence of conservation actions. Though the threat of extinction is increasing, overall declines would have been worse in the absence of conservation. Using data for 25,780 species categorized on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List, we present an assessment of the status of the world's vertebrates. One-fifth of species are classified as Threatened, and we show that this figure is increasing: On average, 52 species of mammals, birds, and amphibians move one category closer to extinction each year. However, this overall pattern conceals the impact of conservation successes, and we show that the rate of deterioration would have been at least one-fifth again as much in the absence of these. Nonetheless, current conservation efforts remain insufficient to offset the main drivers of biodiversity loss in these groups: agricultural expansion, logging, overexploitation, and invasive alien species.},

@article{Trimble2014,
	abstract = {Protected areas (PAs) cover 12 {\%} of terrestrial sub-Saharan Africa. However, given the inherent inadequacies of these PAs to cater for all species in conjunction with the effects of climate change and human pressures on PAs, the future of biodiversity depends heavily on the 88 {\%} of land that is unprotected. The study of biodiversity patterns and the processes that maintain them in human-modified landscapes can provide a valuable evidence base to support science-based policy-making that seeks to make land outside of PAs as amenable as possible for biodiversity persistence. We discuss the literature on biodiversity in sub-Saharan Africa's human-modified landscapes as it relates to four broad ecosystem categorizations (i.e. rangelands, tropical forest, the Cape Floristic Region, and the urban and rural built environment) within which we expect similar patterns of biodiversity persistence in relation to specific human land uses and land management actions. Available research demonstrates the potential contribution of biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes within all four ecosystem types and goes some way towards providing general conclusions that could support policy-making. Nonetheless, conservation success in human-modified landscapes is hampered by constraints requiring further scientific investment, e.g. deficiencies in the available research, uncertainties regarding implementation strategies, and difficulties of coexisting with biodiversity. However, information currently available can and should support efforts at individual, community, provincial, national, and international levels to support biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes.},

@article{Naeem2000,
	abstract = {Biological invasion is a widespread, but poorly understood phenomenon. Elton's hypothesis, supported by theory, experiment, and anecdotal evidence, suggests that an important determinant of invasion success is resident biodiversity, arguing that high diversity increases the competitive environment of communities and makes them more difficult to invade. Observational studies of plant invasions, however, find little support for this hypothesis and argue strongly against it. Lack of control of extrinsic factors (e.g., disturbance, climate, or soil fertility) that covary with biodiversity and invasion in observational studies makes it difficult to determine if their findings truly refute Elton's hypothesis. We examined performance of Crepis tectorum (an invasive, annual composite weed) in experimental prairie grassland plots and greenhouse plant assemblages in which resident species richness was directly manipulated. Under these conditions, unlike observational studies, no covarying extrinsic factors could interfere with interpreting results. We found a strong inverse association between resident diversity and invader performance as predicted by Elton's hypothesis. Higher resident diversity increased crowding, decreased available light, and decreased available nutrients all of which increased the competitive environment of diverse plant assemblages and reduced C. tectorum success. Examination of individual resident species impacts on C. tectorum performance demonstrated that this diversity effect was not due to the sampling effect. These results suggest that both Elton's hypothesis and its competitive mechanism may operate in nature, but covarying extrinsic factors may obscure the negative impact of diversity on invader success.},

@article{Frankham2012,
	abstract = {The ∼26 definitions of species often yield different numbers of species and disparate groupings, with financial, legal, biological and conservation implications. Using conservation genetic considerations, we demonstrate that different species concepts have a critical bearing on our ability to conserve species. Many species of animals and plants persist as small isolated populations suffering inbreeding depression, loss of genetic diversity, and elevated extinction risks. Such small populations usually can be rescued by restoring gene flow, but substantial genetic drift effects can lead them to be classified as distinct species under the diagnostic phylogenetic species concept. Minimum harm to fitness is done and maximum potential fitness and evolutionary potential benefits accrue when reproductive isolation (pre- and/or post-zygotic) is used as the criterion to define distinct species. For sympatric populations, distinct species are diagnosed by very limited gene flow. For allopatric populations, both minimal gene flow and evidence of reduced reproductive fitness in crosses (or effects predicted from adaptive differentiation among populations and/or fixed chromosomal differences) are required to satisfy conservation issues. Species delineations based upon the biological and differential fitness species concepts meet the above requirements. Conversely, if species are delineated using the diagnostic phylogenetic species concept, genetic rescue of small genetically isolated populations may require crosses between species, with consequent legal and regulatory ramifications that could preclude actions to prevent extinction. Consequently, we conclude that the diagnostic phylogenetic species concept is unsuitable for use in conservation contexts, especially for classifying allopatric populations.},

@article{Duffy2009,
	abstract = {Controlled experiments have substantially advanced our understanding of the links between changing biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) in recent years. However, controversy continues regarding the relevance of BEF experiments to the complex ecosystems and large spatial and temporal scales of interest in conservation and management. Here, I address some of the persistent criticisms regarding experimental BEF research and argue that these have been overstated. Contrary to some suggestions, many putative artifacts attributed to experiments render their conclusions about BEF links stronger, rather than weaker. Like other broad ecological concepts, BEF focuses on general patterns, rather than looking at species-level, applied conservation problems. Nevertheless, insights from BEF experiments conducted to date are likely to underestimate, rather than overestimate, the importance of biodiversity to ecosystem functioning and the provision of ecosystem services in the real world. These experiments suggest that managing ecosystems to promote biodiversity can have important practical benefits.},

@article{Hooper2005,
	abstract = {Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1) Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species, ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.},

Most notably, scientists now widely acknowledge that we live in a world dominated by humans, and therefore, the scientific underpinnings of conservation must include a consideration of the role of humans. Today's conservation science incorporates conservation biology into a broader interdisciplinary field that explicitly recognizes the tight coupling of social and natural systems. Emerging priorities include pursuing conservation within working landscapes, rebuilding public support, working with the corporate sector, and paying better attention to human rights and equity. We argue that in conservation, strategies must be promoted that simultaneously maximize the preservation of biodiversity and the improvement of human well-being.}},

@article{Alvard1993,
	abstract = {Native peoples have often been portrayed as natural conservationists, living in ``harmony'' with their environment. It is argued that this perspective is a result of an imprecise definition of conservation that emphasizes effects rather than actual behavior. Using foraging theory as a contrast, an operational definition of conservation is offered. Foraging theory assumes that foragers will behave to maximize their short-term harvesting rate. Hunting decisions that are costly in terms of short-term harvest rate maximization, yet increase the sustainability of the harvest are deemed conservation. Using this definition, alternative hypotheses are tested using data on the inter-specific prey choice decisions of a group of subsistence hunters, the Piro of Amazonian Peru. Results indicate that hunters do not show any restraint from harvesting species identified as vulnerable to over-hunting and local extinction. Decisions are made that are consistent with predictions of foraging theory.},

Conservation and the Genomics of Populations gives a comprehensive overview of the essential background, concepts, and tools needed to understand how genetic information can be used to conserve species threatened with extinction, and to manage species of ecological or commercial importance. New molecular techniques, statistical methods, and computer programs, genetic principles, and methods are becoming increasingly useful in the conservation of biological diversity. Using a balance of data and theory, coupled with basic and applied research examples, this book examines genetic and phenotypic variation in natural populations, the principles and mechanisms of evolutionary change, the interpretation of genetic data from natural populations, and how these can be applied to conservation. The book includes examples from plants, animals, and microbes in wild and captive populations. This third edition has been thoroughly revised to include advances in genomics and contains new chapters on population genomics, genetic monitoring, and conservation genetics in practice, as well as new sections on climate change, emerging diseases, metagenomics, and more. More than one-third of the references in this edition were published after the previous edition. Each of the 24 chapters and the Appendix end with a Guest Box written by an expert who provides an example of the principles presented in the chapter from their own work. This book is essential for advanced undergraduate and graduate students of conservation genetics, natural resource management, and conservation biology, as well as professional conservation biologists and policy-makers working for wildlife and habitat management agencies. Much of the book will also interest nonprofessionals who are curious about the role of genetics in conservation and management of wild and captive populations.}},

Because health and disease are defined against ``normal'' or reference standards, the importance of appropriate reference values cannot be overstated. Unfortunately, in avian and reptile medicine, generation of appropriate sex-, age-, and species-specific reference values is often challenging owing to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient sample number and volume. Consequently, many clinical or diagnostic laboratories do not have their own reference values for most species, and many of the diagnostic or clinical laboratories that provide reference values have obtained those values from the literature or from other diagnostic facilities. Finding reference values for some species is sufficient victory that we often forget to ascertain the appropriateness or even validity of those values. The aims of this report are to provoke the clinician to address the appropriateness of the reference values in use, to consider the source of the reference values in clinical decision making, and to provide recommended guidelines for generating population-based reference values.},

@article{Miller2022,
	abstract = {The idea of `key innovations' has long been influential in theoretical and empirical approaches to understanding adaptive diversification. Despite originally revolving around traits inducing major ecological shifts, the key innovation concept itself has evolved, conflating lineage diversification with trait-dependent ecological shifts. In this opinion article we synthesize the history of the term, clarify the relationship between key innovations and adaptive radiation, and propose a return to the original concept of key innovations: the evolution of organismal features which permit a species to occupy a previously inaccessible ecological state. Ultimately, we suggest an integrative approach to studying key innovations, necessitating experimental approaches of form and function, natural history studies of resource use, and phylogenetic comparative perspectives.},

For example, based on gene sequence and microsatellite data, the method has been used to choose between competing models of human demographic history as well as to infer growth rates, times of divergence, and other parameters. The method fits naturally in the Bayesian inferential framework, and a brief overview is given of the key concepts. Three main approaches to ABC have been developed, and these are described and compared. Although the method arose in population genetics, ABC is increasingly used in other fields, including epidemiology, systems biology, ecology, and agent-based modeling, and many of these applications are briefly described.},

	abstract = {The leopard gecko, Eublepharis macularius, is a widely used model organism in laboratory and experimental studies. The high phenotypic diversity in the pet trade, the fact that the provenance of different breeding lines is unknown, and that distinct Eublepharis species are known to hybridize, implies that the continued use of E. macularius as a model requires clarity on the origin of the lineages in the pet trade. We combine multi-locus sequence data and the first range-wide sampling of the genus Eublepharis to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the Eublepharidae and Eublepharis, with an updated time-tree for the Eublepharidae. Our sampling includes five of the six recognized species and additional nominal taxa of uncertain status comprising 43 samples from 34 localities plus 48 pet-trade samples. The Eublepharidae began diversifying in the Cretaceous. Eublepharis split from its sister genera in Africa in the Palaeocene-Eocene, and began diversifying in the Oligocene-Miocene, with late Miocene-Pliocene cladogenesis giving rise to extant species. The current species diversity within this group is moderately underestimated. Our species delimitation suggests 10 species with four potentially unnamed divergent lineages in Iran, India and Pakistan. All 30 individuals of E. macularius that we sampled from the pet trade, which include diverse morphotypes, come from a few shallow E. macularius clades, confirming that lab and pet trade strains are part of a single taxon. One of the wild-caught haplotypes of E. macularius, from near Karachi, Pakistan, is identical to (10) pet-trade samples and all other captive populations are closely related to wild-caught animals from central/southern Pakistan (0.1--0.5 % minimum pairwise uncorrected ND2 sequence divergence).},

	abstract = {Know the breeding system of endemic plants is important to design conservation strategies. Translocations are actions to improve the survival prospects of the species, but nowadays there are only a few studies that analyse their success and make a comparison between translocation and the natural populations. Dianthus morisianus is a threatened narrow endemic plant species growing on sand dunes in SW Sardinia (Italy). The objective of this study was to assess the breeding system, the presence of inbreeding depression and pollen limitation, as well as the success of the plant translocation. All these results were compared with those from the single natural population. The breeding system was tested through five pollination treatments and the reproductive success was analysed by the fruit set, seed set, seed weight, germination and mortality rate. The translocated population behaved like the natural one on fruit and seed formation. Autonomous self-pollination was lower than the other treatments regarding fruit set and seed/ovule ratio in the two studied populations. The species is self-compatible and presents partial self-fertility. The selfing rate was higher in the translocated population and the inbreeding depression presented low values for the natural population, while the translocated population presented negative values. Neither of the populations suffered pollen limitation. The species did not present reproductive problems and it is pollinator dependent. Moreover, the translocated population demonstrated high success after five years, as an increase of the population area and new recruited plants was observed; the offspring were able to flower, fruiting and reproduce. This translocation success increases the survival prospects of the species.},

@article{Robinson2022,
	abstract = {In cases of severe wildlife population decline, a key question is whether recovery efforts will be impeded by genetic factors, such as inbreeding depression. Decades of excess mortality from gillnet fishing have driven Mexico's vaquita porpoise (Phocoena sinus) to ~10 remaining individuals. We analyzed whole-genome sequences from 20 vaquitas and integrated genomic and demographic information into stochastic, individual-based simulations to quantify the species' recovery potential. Our analysis suggests that the vaquita's historical rarity has resulted in a low burden of segregating deleterious variation, reducing the risk of inbreeding depression. Similarly, genome-informed simulations suggest that the vaquita can recover if bycatch mortality is immediately halted. This study provides hope for vaquitas and other naturally rare endangered species and highlights the utility of genomics in predicting extinction risk. The vaquita porpoise is one of the most endangered animals in the world, with only an estimated 10 individuals remaining. To determine the risk of extinction caused by inbreeding depression, Robinson et al. sequenced and examined 20 vaquita genomes to determine their heterozygosity and ancestral population size (see the Perspective by Grueber and Sunnucks). The authors determined that the long-term population size of vaquitas has been low for a marine mammal, with approximately 1000 years of stable genomic diversity. Genomic comparisons with other cetacean species and modeling indicated that vaquitas are unlikely to suffer from inbreeding depression. Therefore, if the risk of bycatch mortality caused by fishermen can be eliminated, then there is a chance that this species will not go extinct. ---LMZ Genomic and population viability analyses suggest that the vaquita porpoise is not doomed to extinction.},

@article{Colosimo2022b,
	abstract = {Critically endangered Gal{\'a}pagos pink land iguanas, Conolophus marthae, are considered a rare and elusive species. These iguanas are endemic to Wolf Volcano, on Isabela Island (Gal{\'a}pagos), where they persist as a single, very small population on the northwestern slope of the volcano. In an attempt to unveil important information about their ecology and behavior we monitored and analyzed the movement data of a male C. marthae collected over a period of 159 days, from 25 September 2019 until 3 March 2020. We used a custom designed GPS-Wireless Sensor Node (WSN) to remotely track and describe the migration pattern of this individual. Using GPS location data and trajectory reconstruction we documented an altitudinal shift of more than 1000 m. These results not only agree with observations recorded while collecting data in the field but were also used to reconstruct and describe the individual's migratory behavior, and to document the potential path that this individual, and presumably others of this species, follow while searching for food or mates. The altitudinal shift described whether shared across individuals of the species or part of intraspecific variation, may be related to different factors. Here, we discuss alternative interpretations of this behavior. The urgent need to gather data on the species' ecology and develop an appropriate conservation strategy underlines the importance of this research. Although it is not possible to draw conclusions for an entire species based on results from one individual, this work represents a significant advancement for the conservation of this species, as it validates the importance of using cutting-edge remote-tracking technology to collect data on a very elusive species, and it reveals ecological traits not previously documented for these critically endangered iguanas.},

	abstract = {Abstract Quantifying movement and demographic events of free-ranging animals is fundamental to studying their ecology, evolution and conservation. Technological advances have led to an explosion in sensor-based methods for remotely observing these phenomena. This transition to big data creates new challenges for data management, analysis and collaboration. We present the Movebank ecosystem of tools used by thousands of researchers to collect, manage, share, visualize, analyse and archive their animal tracking and other animal-borne sensor data. Users add sensor data through file uploads or live data streams and further organize and complete quality control within the Movebank system. All data are harmonized to a data model and vocabulary. The public can discover, view and download data for which they have been given access to through the website, the Animal Tracker mobile app or by API. Advanced analysis tools are available through the EnvDATA System, the MoveApps platform and a variety of user-developed applications. Data owners can share studies with select users or the public, with options for embargos, licenses and formal archiving in a data repository. Movebank is used by over 3,100 data owners globally, who manage over 6 billion animal location and sensor measurements across more than 6,500 studies, with thousands of active tags sending over 3 million new data records daily. These data underlie >700 published papers and reports. We present a case study demonstrating the use of Movebank to assess life-history events and demography, and engage with citizen scientists to identify mortalities and causes of death for a migratory bird. A growing number of researchers, government agencies and conservation organizations use Movebank to manage research and conservation projects and to meet legislative requirements. The combination of historic and new data with collaboration tools enables broad comparative analyses and data acquisition and mapping efforts. Movebank offers an integrated system for real-time monitoring of animals at a global scale and represents a digital museum of animal movement and behaviour. Resources and coordination across countries and organizations are needed to ensure that these data, including those that cannot be made public, remain accessible to future generations.},

@article{Palsboll1999,
	abstract = {Population genetic analyses have been highly successful in deciphering inter- and intra-specific evolutionary relationships, levels of gene flow, genetic divergence and effective population sizes. Parameters estimated by traditional population genetic analyses are evolutionary averages and thus not necessarily relevant for contemporary ecological or conservation issues. Molecular data can, however, also provide insight into contemporary patterns of divergence, population size and gene flow when a sufficient number of variable loci are analysed to focus subsequent data analyses on individuals rather than populations. Genetic tagging of individuals is an example of such individual-based approaches and recent studies have shown it to be a viable alternative to traditional tagging methods. Owing to the ubiquitous presence of hyper-variable DNA sequences in eukaryote genomes it is in principle possible to tag any eukaryote species and the required DNA can be obtained indirectly from substrates such as faeces, sloughed skin and hair. The purpose of this paper is to present the concept of genetic tagging and to further advocate the extension of individual-based genetic analyses beyond the identification of individuals to other kinds of relationships, such as parent-offspring relations, which more fully exploit the genetic nature of the data.},

	abstract = {1. The recently developed Brownian bridge movement model (BBMM) has advantages over traditional methods because it quantifies the utilization distribution of an animal based on its movement path rather than individual points and accounts for temporal autocorrelation and high data volumes. However, the BBMM assumes unrealistic homogeneous movement behaviour across all data. 2. Accurate quantification of the utilization distribution is important for identifying the way animals use the landscape. 3. We improve the BBMM by allowing for changes in behaviour, using likelihood statistics to determine change points along the animal's movement path. 4. This novel extension, outperforms the current BBMM as indicated by simulations and examples of a territorial mammal and a migratory bird. The unique ability of our model to work with tracks that are not sampled regularly is especially important for GPS tags that have frequent failed fixes or dynamic sampling schedules. Moreover, our model extension provides a useful one-dimensional measure of behavioural change along animal tracks. 5. This new method provides a more accurate utilization distribution that better describes the space use of realistic, behaviourally heterogeneous tracks.},

@article{Horne2007,
	abstract = {By studying animal movements, researchers can gain insight into many of the ecological characteristics and processes important for understanding population-level dynamics. We developed a Brownian bridge movement model (BBMM) for estimating the expected movement path of an animal, using discrete location data obtained at relatively short time intervals. The BBMM is based on the properties of a conditional random walk between successive pairs of locations, dependent on the time between locations, the distance between locations, and the Brownian motion variance that is related to the animal's mobility. We describe two critical developments that enable widespread use of the BBMM, including a derivation of the model when location data are measured with error and a maximum likelihood approach for estimating the Brownian motion variance. After the BBMM is fitted to location data, an estimate of the animal's probability of occurrence can be generated for an area during the time of observation. To illustrate potential applications, we provide three examples: estimating animal home ranges, estimating animal migration routes, and evaluating the influence of fine-scale resource selection on animal movement patterns.},

	abstract = {The conservation of animal populations often requires the estimation of population size. Low density and secretive behaviour usually determine scarce data sources and hampers precise abundance estimations of carnivore populations. However, joint analysis of independent scarce data sources in a common modeling framework allows unbiased and precise estimates of population parameters. We aimed to estimate the density of the European wildcat (Felis silvestris) in a protected area of Spain, by combining independent datasets in a spatially-explicit capture-recapture (SCR) framework. Data from live-capture with individual identification, camera-trapping without individual identification and radio-tracking concurrently obtained were integrated in a joint SCR and count data model. Ten live captures of five wildcats were obtained with an effort of 2034 trap-days, whereas seven wildcat independent events were recorded in camera traps with 3628 camera-days. Two wildcats were radio-tagged and telemetry information on their movements was obtained. The integration of the different data sources improved the precision obtained by the standard SCR model. The mean ($\pm$SD) density estimated with the integrated model (0.038 $\pm$0.017 wildcats/km2, 95{\%} highest posterior density 0.013--0.082) is among the lowest values ever reported for this species, despite corresponding to a highly protected area. Among the likely causes of such low density, low prey availability could have triggered an extinction vortex process. We postulate that the estimated low density could represent a common situation of wildcat populations in the southern Iberia, highlighting the need for further studies and urgent conservation actions in the furthermost southwestern range of this species in Europe.},

	abstract = {A resource selection function (RSF) is any model that yields values proportional to the probability of use of a resource unit. RSF models often are fitted using generalized linear models (GLMs) although a variety of statistical models might be used. Information criteria such as the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) are tools that can be useful for selecting a model from a set of biologically plausible candidates. Statistical inference procedures, such as the likelihood-ratio test, can be used to assess whether models deviate from random null models. But for most applications of RSF models, usefulness is evaluated by how well the model predicts the location of organisms on a landscape. Predictions from RSF models constructed using presence/absence (used/unused) data can be evaluated using procedures developed for logistic regression, such as confusion matrices, Kappa statistics, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. However, RSF models estimated from presence/available data create unique problems for evaluating model predictions. For presence/available models we propose a form of k-fold cross validation for evaluating prediction success. This involves calculating the correlation between RSF ranks and area-adjusted frequencies for a withheld sub-sample of data. A similar approach can be applied to evaluate predictive success for out-of-sample data. Not all RSF models are robust for application in different times or different places due to ecological and behavioral variation of the target organisms.},

	abstract = {Summary Models accounting for imperfect detection are important. Single-visit (SV) methods have been proposed as an alternative to multiple-visit methods to relax the assumption of closed population. Knape \& Korner-Nievergelt (Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 2015) showed that under certain models of probability of detection, SV methods are statistically non-identifiable leading to biased population estimates. There is a close relationship between estimation of the resource selection probability function (RSPF) using weighted distributions and SV methods for occupancy and abundance estimation. We explain the precise mathematical conditions needed for RSPF estimation as stated in Lele \& Keim (Ecology, 87, 2006, 3021). The identical conditions that remained unstated in our papers on SV methodology are needed for SV methodology to work. We show that the class of admissible models is quite broad and does not excessively restrict the application of the RSPF or the SV methodology. To complement the work by Knape and Korner-Nievergelt, we study the performance of multiple-visit methods under the scaled logistic detection function and a much wider set of situations. In general, under the scaled logistic detection function, multiple-visit methods also lead to biased estimates. As a solution to this problem, we extend the SV methodology to a class of models that allows use of scaled probability function. We propose a multinomial extension of SV methodology that can be used to check whether the detection function satisfies the RSPF condition or not. Furthermore, we show that if the scaling factor depends on covariates, then it can also be estimated. We argue that the instances where the RSPF condition is not satisfied are rare in practice. Hence, we disagree with the implication in Knape \& Korner-Nievergelt (Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 2015) that the need for RSPF condition makes SV methodology irrelevant in practice.},

	abstract = {{Understanding the factors that affect hybridization is an important issue in the study of species evolution. In this work, we analyse the genetic structure of two lizard species, Salvator merianae and Salvator rufescens, at a microscale within a climatic niche analysis framework, to reveal the main factors that contribute to the stability of their hybrid zone. We assess the effect of climate in hybridization by quantifying and decomposing the niche overlap of both species. Using a mitochondrial and a nuclear marker, we find that hybridization is frequent and is not restricted to the sympatric region. The gene flow is mainly from S. rufescens to S. merianae, with introgression into the range of S. merianae. Also, S. merianae would have long been present in the area, while S. rufescens appears to be a recent colonizer. The climate contributes to the population structure of S. merianae, but not to that of S. rufescens. The niches occupied by S. rufescens in the hybrid zone and the non-hybrid zone are similar, while the niches of S. merianae are different. Our results do not fit previous models of hybrid zone stability, suggesting the need to develop new models that consider the evolutionary factors that can differentially affect parental species and hybrids.}},

	abstract = {Animal movement receives widespread attention within ecology and behavior. However, much research is restricted within isolated sub-disciplines focusing on single phenomena such as navigation (e.g. homing behavior), search strategies (e.g. Levy flights) or theoretical considerations of optimal population dispersion (e.g. ideal free distribution). To help synthesize existing research, we outline a unifying conceptual framework that integrates individual-level behaviors and population-level spatial distributions with respect to spatio-temporal resource dynamics. We distinguish among (1) non-oriented movements based on diffusion and kinesis in response to proximate stimuli, (2) oriented movements utilizing perceptual cues of distant targets, and (3) memory mechanisms that assume prior knowledge of a target's location. Species' use of these mechanisms depends on life-history traits and resource dynamics, which together shape population-level patterns. Resources with little spatial variability should facilitate sedentary ranges, whereas resources with predictable seasonal variation in spatial distributions should generate migratory patterns. A third pattern, `nomadism', should emerge when resource distributions are unpredictable in both space and time. We summarize recent advances in analyses of animal trajectories and outline three major components on which future studies should focus: (1) integration across alternative movement mechanisms involving links between state variables and specific mechanisms, (2) consideration of dynamics in resource landscapes or environments that include resource gradients in predictability, variability, scale, and abundance, and finally (3) quantitative methods to distinguish among population distributions. We suggest that combining techniques such as evolutionary programming and pattern oriented modeling will help to build strong links between underlying movement mechanisms and broad-scale population distributions.},

@article{Calabrese2016,
	abstract = {Summary Movement ecology has developed rapidly over the past decade, driven by advances in tracking technology that have largely removed data limitations. Development of rigorous analytical tools has lagged behind empirical progress, and as a result, relocation data sets have been underutilized. Discrete-time correlated random walk models (CRW) have long served as the foundation for analyzing relocation data. Unfortunately, CRWs confound the sampling and movement processes. CRW parameter estimates thus depend sensitively on the sampling schedule, which makes it difficult to draw sampling-independent inferences about the underlying movement process. Furthermore, CRWs cannot accommodate the multiscale autocorrelations that typify modern, finely sampled relocation data sets. Recent developments in modelling movement as a continuous-time stochastic process (CTSP) solve these problems, but the mathematical difficulty of using CTSPs has limited their adoption in ecology. To remove this roadblock, we introduce the ctmm package for the R statistical computing environment. ctmm implements all of the CTSPs currently in use in the ecological literature and couples them with powerful statistical methods for autocorrelated data adapted from geostatistics and signal processing, including variograms, periodograms and non-Markovian maximum likelihood estimation. ctmm is built around a standard workflow that begins with visual diagnostics, proceeds to candidate model identification, and then to maximum likelihood fitting and AIC-based model selection. Once an accurate CTSP for the data has been fitted and selected, analyses that require such a model, such as quantifying home range areas via autocorrelated kernel density estimation or estimating occurrence distributions via time-series Kriging, can then be performed. We use a case study with African buffalo to demonstrate the capabilities of ctmm and highlight the steps of a typical CTSP movement analysis workflow.},

	abstract = {Abstract Home range estimation is routine practice in ecological research. While advances in animal tracking technology have increased our capacity to collect data to support home range analysis, these same advances have also resulted in increasingly autocorrelated data. Consequently, the question of which home range estimator to use on modern, highly autocorrelated tracking data remains open. This question is particularly relevant given that most estimators assume independently sampled data. Here, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of autocorrelation on home range estimation. We base our study on an extensive data set of GPS locations from 369 individuals representing 27 species distributed across five continents. We first assemble a broad array of home range estimators, including Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) with four bandwidth optimizers (Gaussian reference function, autocorrelated-Gaussian reference function [AKDE], Silverman's rule of thumb, and least squares cross-validation), Minimum Convex Polygon, and Local Convex Hull methods. Notably, all of these estimators except AKDE assume independent and identically distributed (IID) data. We then employ half-sample cross-validation to objectively quantify estimator performance, and the recently introduced effective sample size for home range area estimation (N^area) to quantify the information content of each data set. We found that AKDE 95\% area estimates were larger than conventional IID-based estimates by a mean factor of 2. The median number of cross-validated locations included in the hold-out sets by AKDE 95\% (or 50\%) estimates was 95.3\% (or 50.1\%), confirming the larger AKDE ranges were appropriately selective at the specified quantile. Conversely, conventional estimates exhibited negative bias that increased with decreasing N^area. To contextualize our empirical results, we performed a detailed simulation study to tease apart how sampling frequency, sampling duration, and the focal animal's movement conspire to affect range estimates. Paralleling our empirical results, the simulation study demonstrated that AKDE was generally more accurate than conventional methods, particularly for small N^area. While 72\% of the 369 empirical data sets had >1,000 total observations, only 4\% had an N^area >1,000, where 30\% had an N^area <30.

	abstract = {The Galapagos Islands are a global hotspot of environmental change. However, despite their potentially major repercussions, little is known about current and expected changes in regional terrestrial climate variables and sea surface temperatures (SST). Here, by analysing existing meteorological observations and secondary datasets, we find that the Islands have warmed by about 0.6 $\,^{\circ}$C since the early 1980s, while at the same time becoming drier. In fact, the onset of the wet season is currently delayed 20 days. This drying trend may reverse, however, given that future climate projections for the region suggest mean annual precipitation may increase between 20 and 70{\%}. This would also be accompanied by more extreme wet and hot conditions. Further, we find that regional SST has increased by 1.2 $\,^{\circ}$C over the last two decades. These changes will, in turn, translate into deterioration of marine ecosystems and coral, proliferation of invasive species, and damages to human water, food, and infrastructure systems. Future projections, however, may be overestimated due to the poor capacity of climatic models to capture Eastern-Pacific ENSO dynamics. Our findings emphasize the need to design resilient climate adaptation policies that will remain robust in the face of a wide range of uncertain and changing climatic futures.},

	abstract = {The majority of lizards classified in the superfamily Iguanoidea have an XX/XY sex-determination system in which sex-chromosomal linkage shows homology with chicken (Gallus gallus) chromosome 15 (GGA15). However, the genomics of sex chromosomes remain largely unexplored owing to the presence of homomorphic sex chromosomes in majority of the species. Recent advances in high-throughput genome complexity reduction sequencing provide an effective approach to the identification of sex-specific loci with both single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and restriction fragment presence/absence (PA), and a better understanding of sex chromosome dynamics in Iguanoidea. In this study, we applied Diversity Arrays Technology (DArTseq<sup>TM</sup>) in 29 phenotypic sex assignments (14 males and 15 females) of green iguana (Iguana iguana). We confirmed a male heterogametic (XX/XY) sex determination mode in this species, identifying 29 perfectly sex-linked SNP/PA loci and 164 moderately sex-linked SNP/PA loci, providing evidence probably indicative of XY recombination. Three loci from among the perfectly sex-linked SNP/PA loci showed partial homology with several amniote sex chromosomal linkages. The results support the hypothesis of an ancestral super-sex chromosome with overlaps of partial sex-chromosomal linkages. However, only one locus among the moderately sex-linked loci showed homology with GGA15, which suggests that the specific region homologous to GGA15 was located outside the non-recombination region but in close proximity to this region of the sex chromosome in green iguana. Therefore, the location of GGA15 might be further from the putative sex-determination locus in green iguana. This is a paradigm shift in understanding linkages on homomorphic X and Y sex chromosomes. The DArTseq platform provides an easy-to-use strategy for future research on the evolution of sex chromosomes in Iguanoidea, particularly for non-model species with homomorphic or highly cryptic sex chromosomes.},

	abstract = {Abstract Sympatric species are expected to differ in ecological requirements to minimize niche overlap and avoid competition. Here we assess the trophic interactions among three coexisting dolphin species from southern Brazil: the franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei), the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis), and the Lahille's bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus gephyreus). We evaluated temporal variation in carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotope values of bone collagen to examine potential dietary shifts resulting from increased fishing activity over the past three decades. We estimated the degree of niche overlap among these species and the contribution of potential prey sources to their diet. δ15N values were consistent among species and across years, while δ13C values increased for Guiana dolphins and decreased for bottlenose dolphins, suggesting changes in diet and/or foraging habitats through time. The similar δ13C and δ15N values and the high niche overlap between Guiana and bottlenose dolphins indicate that these species are primarily feeding on demersal prey. The franciscana diet is primarily composed of pelagic prey, resulting in a lower niche overlap in comparison with the other dolphin species. Our study provides further information about the foraging ecology of this unique dolphin community in southern Brazil with implications for its management and conservation.},

@article{Flores-Escobar2020,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Ecological similarity between species can lead to interspecific trophic competition. However, when ecologically similar species coexist, they may differ in foraging strategies and habitat use, which can lead to niche partitioning. As the body tissues of consumers contain a stable isotope signature that reflects the isotopic composition of their diet, stable isotope analysis is a useful tool to study feeding behavior. We measured the isotopic niche width, which is a proxy for trophic niche width, of mantled (Alouatta palliata) and black (A. pigra) howler monkeys. Specifically, studied populations in allopatry and sympatry to assess whether these species showed niche partitioning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2008 and 2012, we collected hair samples from 200 subjects (113 black and 87 mantled howler monkeys) and used continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry to estimate δ(13) C and δ(15) N. We described the isotopic niche width of each species in allopatry and sympatry with the Bayesian estimation of the standard ellipse areas. RESULTS: In allopatry, isotopic niche width and isotopic variation were similar in both species. In sympatry, black howler monkeys had a significantly broader isotopic niche, which was mainly determined by high δ(15) N values, and included the majority of mantled howler monkeys' isotopic niche. The isotopic niche of mantled howler monkeys did not differ between sympatry and allopatry. CONCLUSIONS: The coexistence of these ecologically similar species may be linked to trophic niche adjustments by one species, although the particular features of such adjustments (e.g., dietary, spatial, or sensory partitioning) remain to be addressed.},

	abstract = {Stable isotope analyses have become an important tool in reconstructing diets, analysing resource use patterns, elucidating trophic relations among predators and understanding the structure of food webs. Here, we use stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in bone collagen to reconstruct and compare the isotopic niches of adult South American fur seals (Arctocephalus australis; n = 86) and sea lions (Otaria flavescens; n = 49) - two otariid species with marked morphological differences - in the R{\'\i}o de la Plata estuary (Argentina - Uruguay) and the adjacent Atlantic Ocean during the second half of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century. Samples from the middle Holocene (n = 7 fur seals and n = 5 sea lions) are also included in order to provide a reference point for characterizing resource partitioning before major anthropogenic modifications of the environment. We found that the South American fur seals and South American sea lions had distinct isotopic niches during the middle Holocene. Isotopic niche segregation was similar at the beginning of the second half of the 20th century, but has diminished over time. The progressive convergence of the isotopic niches of these two otariids during the second half of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century is most likely due to the increased reliance of South American fur seals on demersal prey. This recent dietary change in South American fur seals can be explained by at least two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms: (i) the decrease in the abundance of sympatric South American sea lions as a consequence of small colony size and high pup mortality resulting from commercial sealing; and (ii) the decrease in the average size of demersal fishes due to intense fishing of the larger class sizes, which may have increased their accessibility to those eared seals with a smaller mouth gape, that is, South American fur seals of both sexes and female South American sea lions.},

	abstract = {The influence of diet on the distribution of nitrogen isotopes in animals was investigated by analyzing animals grown in the laboratory on diets of constant nitrogen isotopic composition. The isotopic composition of the nitrogen in an animal reflects the nitrogen isotopic composition of its diet. The δ15N values of the whole bodies of animals are usually more positive than those of their diets. Different individuals of a species raised on the same diet can have significantly different δ15N values. The variability of the relationship between the δ15N values of animals and their diets is greater for different species raised on the same diet than for the same species raised on different diets. Different tissues of mice are also enriched in 15N relative to the diet, with the difference between the δ15N values of a tissue and the diet depending on both the kind of tissue and the diet involved. The δ15N values ofcollagen and chitin. biochemical components that are often preserved in fossil animal remains, are also related to the δ15N value of the diet. The dependence of the δ15N values of whole animals and their tissues and biochemical components on the δ15N value of diet indicates that the isotopic composition of animal nitrogen can be used to obtain information about an animal's diet if its potential food sources had different δ15N values. The nitrogen isotopic method of dietary analysis probably can be used to estimate the relative use of legumes vs non-legumes or of aquatic vs terrestrial organisms as food sources for extant and fossil animals. However, the method probably will not be applicable in those modern ecosystems in which the use of chemical fertilizers has influenced the distribution of nitrogen isotopes in food sources. The isotopic method of dietary analysis was used to reconstruct changes in the diet of the human population that occupied the Tehuacan Valley of Mexico over a 7000 yr span. Variations in the δ15C and δ15N values of bone collagen suggest that C4 and/or CAM plants (presumably mostly corn) and legumes (presumably mostly beans) were introduced into the diet much earlier than suggested by conventional archaeological analysis.},

	abstract = {The influence of diet on the distribution of carbon isotopes in animals was investigated by analyzing animals grown in the laboratory on diets of constant carbon isotopic composition. The isotopic composition of the whole body of an animal reflects the isotopic composition of its diet, but the animal is on average enriched in δ13C by about 1‰ relative to the diet. In three of the four cases examined, the 13C enrichment of the whole body relative to the diet is balanced by a 13C depletion of the respired CO2. The isotopic relationships between the whole bodies of animals and their diets are similar for different species raised on the same diet and for the same species raised on different diets. However, the δ13C values of whole bodies of individuals of a species raised on the same diet may differ by up to 2‰. The relationship between the 13C/12C ratio of a tissue and the 13C/12C ratio of the diet depends both on the type of tissue and on the nature of the diet. Many of the isotopic relationships among the major biochemical fractions, namely the lipid, carbohydrate and protein fractions, are qualitatively preserved as diet carbon is incorporated into the animal. However, the difference between the δ13C values of a biochemical fraction in an animal and in its diet may be as large as 3‰. The δ13C values of the biochemical components collagen, chitin and the insoluble organic fraction of shells, all of which are often preserved in fossil material, are related to the isotopic composition of the diet. These results indicate that it will be possible to perform dietary analysis based on the determination of the 13C/12C ratio of animal carbon. Analysis of the total animal carbon will in most cases provide a better measure of diet than the analysis of individual tissues, biochemical fractions, or biochemical components. The limits of accuracy of this method will generally restrict its application to situations in which the diet is derived from sources with relatively large differences in their δ13C values, such as terrestrial vs aquatic organisms or C3 vs C4 plants. The method should be applicable to fossil as well as to living material.},

	abstract = {Sexual dimorphism is often associated with different feeding strategies between sexes because of distinct nutritional demands or intake rates. Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) is the most sexually dimorphic grouse, thus sexual segregation in resource use is likely. This study assessed intrapopulation variation in the diet related to habitat use, focusing on differential feeding behaviors between Capercaillie females and males. We used stable isotopes analyses in feathers of Cantabrian Capercaillie, a population living at the southern edge of the range in purely deciduous forests. We analyzed feathers of females and males, and sorted them according to the dominant tree species in the patch where they were found. Mean isotopic values differed both between sexes and among forest types. The latter explained most of the isotopic variance, suggesting that birds consistently selected certain forest types to molt. Capercaillie females showed wider trophic niche and seemingly more intra-gender diversity in resource use than males. The differences between sexes in the trophic variability support the sexual segregation reported in previous studies which is associated with females using the more micro-habitat diverse treeline areas, while males mainly use the inner areas of the forests. Stable isotope analysis proved very useful to assess intersexual niche partitioning in rare species living in rugged terrains where it is logistically difficult to rely on direct approaches (i.e. direct observation, capture and radio-tracking).},

	abstract = {A trophic niche overlap in native and alien turtle species can lead to competitive interactions whereby allochthonous turtles may outcompete autochthonous individuals and eventually affect viability of natural populations. The European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis) is an autochthonous species threatened by habitat encroachment and competition with the red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans). The latter is an invasive species introduced in Europe from midwestern United States as a pet and now widespread in the natural habitats of E. orbicularis. The extent of trophic competition between E. orbicularis and T. s. elegans in northern Italy was assessed by nitrogen and carbon stable isotope analysis (δ15N and δ13C). We used blood and claw samples in order to obtain information on diet components over a short- (3--4 months) and long-term (12 months) time frame, respectively. Analysis of claw samples showed a clear separation between the diets of adults of the two species, but suggested a trophic overlap among adult invaders and young autochthonous turtles. Blood samples, on the other hand, revealed a partial overlap between niches, indicating a short-term correspondence in diet composition between species. We found that, for specific life stages and times of the year, there is potential for trophic competition, which may have important consequences for the management and conservation of E. orbicularis in Italy.},

	abstract = {The extent to which closely related species share similar niches remains highly debated. Ecological niches are increasingly analysed by combining distribution records with broad-scale climatic variables, but interactions between species and their environment often occur at fine scales. The idea that macroscale analyses correctly represent fine-scale processes relies on the assumption that average climatic variables are meaningful predictors of processes determining species persistence, but tests of this hypothesis are scarce. We compared broad- and fine-scale (microhabitat) approaches by analyzing the niches of European plethodontid salamanders. Both the microhabitat and the macroecological approaches identified niche differences among species, but the correspondence between micro- and macroecological niches was weak. When exploring niche evolution, the macroecological approach suggested a close relationship between niche and phylogenetic history, but this relationship did not emerge in fine-scale analyses. The apparent pattern of niche evolution emerging in broad-scale analyses likely was the by-product of related species having closely adjacent ranges. The environment actually experienced by most of animals is more heterogeneous than what is apparent from macro-scale predictors, and a better combination between macroecological and fine-grained data may be a key to obtain robust ecological generalizations.},

	abstract = {A common challenge in species conservation and management is how to incorporate species movements into management objectives. There often is a lack of knowledge of where, when, and why species move. The field of movement ecology has grown rapidly in the last decade and is now providing the knowledge needed to incorporate movements of species into management planning. This knowledge can also be used to develop management strategies that are flexible in time and space and may improve the effectiveness of management actions. Therefore, wildlife management and conservation may benefit by strengthening the link with movement ecology. We present a framework that illustrates how animal movement can be used to enhance conservation planning and identify management actions that are complementary to existing strategies. The framework contains five steps that identify (1) the movement attributes of a species, (2) their impacts on ecosystems, (3) how this knowledge can be used to guide the scale and type of management, (4) the implementation, and (5) the evaluation of management actions. We discuss these five steps in detail, highlighting why the step is important and how the information can be obtained. We illustrate the framework through a case study of managing a highly mobile species, the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), a harvested species of conservation concern. We believe that the movement-management framework provides an important, and timely, link between movement ecology and wildlife management and conservation, and highlights the potential for complementary, dynamic solutions for managing wildlife.},

In plant breeding terms, heterosis refers to increased size, shape, stature, fertility, biomass, and seed yield (or superiority) of hybrids over one or both parents or mid-parent value. Although inbreeding depression and heterosis were first described more than a century ago, no universally accepted theory exists.

	abstract = {Summary The genome-wide heterozygosity at 9590 genes, all heterozygous in a single Eucalyptus grandis parent tree, was examined in a group of 28 S1 offspring. Heterozygosity ranged from 52--79\%, averaging 65.5\%, much higher than the 50\% expected under random segregation, supporting the occurrence of strong (47\%) selection against homozygosity. The expected pattern of heterozygosity from theoretical calculations and simulations for recessive detrimentals (pseudo-overdominance) and intrinsic heterozygote advantage was examined and compared with that observed. The observed patterns are consistent with at least several detrimental loci with large effects on both parental chromosomes of the 11 pairs. It is likely that 100 or more genes, many with substantial effects on viability, are contributing to this inbreeding depression. Although our genome-wide analysis of nearly 10 000 genes strongly suggested that pseudo-overdominance was responsible for the observed high inbreeding depression, heterozygote advantage could not be excluded. Finding inconvertible evidence of the cause of inbreeding depression still presents a difficult challenge. This study is the first theoretical examination of the genomic effect of inbreeding in a forest tree and provides an approach to analyze these data to determine the extent and cause of inbreeding depression across other plant genomes.},

@article{Yao2020,
	abstract = {The genetic and molecular basis of heterosis has long been studied but without a consensus about mechanism. The opposite effect, inbreeding depression, results from repeated self-pollination and leads to a reduction in vigor. A popular explanation for this reaction is the homozygosis of recessive, slightly deleterious alleles upon inbreeding. However, extensive studies in alfalfa indicated that inbreeding between diploids and autotetraploids was similar despite the fact that homozygosis of alleles would be dramatically different. The availability of tetraploid lines of maize generated directly from various inbred lines provided the opportunity to examine this issue in detail in perfectly matched diploid and tetraploid hybrids and their parallel inbreeding regimes. Identical hybrids at the diploid and tetraploid levels were inbred in triplicate for seven generations. At the conclusion of this regime, F1 hybrids and selected representative generations (S1, S3, S5, S7) were characterized phenotypically in randomized blocks during the same field conditions. Quantitative measures of the multiple generations of inbreeding provided little evidence for a distinction in the decline of vigor between the diploids and the tetraploids. The results suggest that the homozygosis of completely recessive, slightly deleterious alleles is an inadequate hypothesis to explain inbreeding depression in general.},

	abstract = {Abstract The endemic pink pigeon has recovered from less than 20 birds in the mid-1970s to 355 free-living individuals in 2003. A major concern for the species' recovery has been the potential genetic problem of inbreeding. Captive pink pigeons bred for reintroduction were managed to maximise founder representation and minimise inbreeding. In this paper, we quantify the effect of inbreeding on survival and reproductive parameters in captive and wild populations and quantify DNA sequence variation in the mitochondrial d-loop region for pink pigeon founders. Inbreeding affected egg fertility, squab, juvenile and adult survival, but effects were strongest in highly inbred birds (F≥0.25). Inbreeding depression was more apparent in free-living birds where even moderate levels of inbreeding affected survival, although highly inbred birds were equally compromised in both captive and wild populations. Mitochondrial DNA haplotypic diversity in pink pigeon founders is low, suggesting that background inbreeding is contributing to low fertility and depressed productivity in this species, as well as comparable survival of some groups of non-inbred and nominally inbred birds. Management of wild populations has boosted population growth and may be required long-term to offset the negative effects of inbreeding depression and enhance the species' survival.},

There was no significant difference between populations founded with wild-caught individuals, a mixture of wild-caught and captive-born individuals, and individuals of unknown origin. The average cost of a parent-offspring or full sibling mating was 0.33, that is, mortality was 33\% higher in offspring of such matings than in offspring of unrelated parents.

	abstract = {Abstract Inbreeding depression is a major force affecting the evolution and viability of small populations in captive breeding and restoration programmes. Populations that experience small sizes may be less susceptible to future inbreeding depression because they have been purged of deleterious recessive alleles. We review issues related to purging, as they apply to the management of small populations, and discuss an experiment we conducted examining purging in populations of mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). Purging is an important process in many small populations, but the literature contains a diversity of responses to purging both within and among studies. With the exception that slow inbreeding results in more purging and less threat to population viability, there seem to be few consistent trends that aid in prediction of how a purging event will affect a population. In our examination of purging on population viability in mosquitofish, single or multiple bottlenecks do not appear to have resulted in any purging of the influence of genetic load on population growth. Rather, serial bottlenecks resulted in a marked decline in population growth and an increase in extinction. Our results, taken together with those of reviewed studies, suggest that in small populations there is great uncertainty regarding the success of any single purging event in eliminating inbreeding depression, together with the high likelihood that purging will depress population viability through the fixation of deleterious alleles. In management of captive breeding and restoration programmes, the common practice of avoiding inbreeding and small population sizes should be followed whenever possible.},

The package also provides wrapper functions that allow users to configure and run popular external programs such as genepop, structure, and fastsimcoal from within r, and smoothly interface with popular r packages adegenet and pegas. stratag is intended to be an open-source dynamic package that will grow with future needs and user input.},

@article{Hirzel2002,
	abstract = {We propose a multivariate approach to the study of geographic species distribution which does not require absence data. Building on Hutchinson's concept of the ecological niche, this factor analysis compares, in the multidimensional space of ecological variables, the distribution of the localities where the focal species was observed to a reference set describing the whole study area. The first factor extracted maximizes the marginality of the focal species, defined as the ecological distance between the species optimum and the mean habitat within the reference area. The other factors maximize the specialization of this focal species, defined as the ratio of the ecological variance in mean habitat to that observed for the focal species. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are readily interpreted and can be used to build habitat-suitability maps. This approach is recommended in situations where absence data are not available (many data banks), unreliable (most cryptic or rare species), or meaningless (invaders). We provide an illustration and validation of the method for the alpine ibex, a species reintroduced in Switzerland which presumably has not yet recolonized its entire range.},

@article{Kaszta2020,
	abstract = {Abstract With increasing loss and fragmentation of habitats driving the emerging global extinction crisis, paired with limited resources for conservation, there is an immense need to identify and prioritize the most important areas for conservation actions. The goal of this study was to measure, map and rank core areas and corridors for mainland clouded leopard (a forest indicator species) across its entire range in Southeast Asia. We used an empirically based landscape resistance model developed from range-wide camera survey data, cumulative resistant kernel analysis to define core areas and least-cost network analysis to identify corridors for long-distance dispersal. We then ranked core areas based on their strength and size, and corridors based on their strength and the strength of core areas they connect. We found that the most important core areas and corridors are concentrated in Southeast Asia, largely in Myanmar, Laos and Malaysia. Myanmar contains nearly the entirety of the first and third highest ranked core areas, as well as the most important network of corridors in SE Asia. Almost the entire territory of Laos constitutes one large potential core area, ranked as the second most important across the clouded leopard's range. A large number (22) of very small (<8000 km2) and fairly isolated core areas are in China. Only 24\% of clouded leopard core areas and 17\% of corridors are protected. This is the first example of using empirical models to prioritize conservation actions across the full range of a large carnivore. Our analysis identifies the location, size and connectivity of the most important remaining habitats of the clouded leopard across its range, which could provide quantitative guidance in the efforts to maximize the efficacy of regional conservation initiatives to conserve this species and the ecosystems it inhabits.},

	abstract = {Conservation of large carnivores, such as the African lion, requires preservation of extensive core habitat areas, linkages between them, and mitigation of human-wildlife conflict. However, there are few rigorous examples of efforts that prioritized conservation actions for all three of these critical components. We used an empirically optimized resistance surface to calculate resistant kernel and factorial least cost path predictions of population connectivity and conflict risk for lions across the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA) and surrounding landscape. We mapped and ranked the relative importance of (1) lion dispersal areas outside National Parks, (2) corridors between the key areas, and (3) areas of highest human-lion conflict risk. Spatial prioritization of conservation actions is critical given extensive land use redesignations that are reducing the extent and increasing the fragmentation of lion populations. While our example focuses on lions in southern Africa, it provides a general approach for rigorous, empirically based comprehensive conservation planning based on spatial prioritization.},

	abstract = {(1) Animals generally use space disproportionately within the boundaries of their home range. Areas receiving concentrated use by resident animals can be termed core areas. Identifying these core areas is an important part of understanding the ecological factors that determine use. (2) Comparison of the observed space-use pattern with that expected from a uniform pattern of use is our basis for defining core areas. The difference in ordered cumulative distribution functions can be tested using a one-sided goodness-of-fit procedure. Core areas are delineated by enscribing those areas within the home range where use exceeds that expected from a uniform distribution. (3) This method of estimating core areas is illustrated with a hypothetical data set and applied to radio-telemetry locations of a black bear (Ursus americanus, Pallas). The bear used two distinct core areas, which enclosed 34% of the total home range and included 76% of the animal locations. (4) Patterns of core area use are demonstrated for male western tanagers (Piranga ludoviciana, Wilson). Although 90% home range boundaries overlap, core areas for four adjacent males are shown to closely resemble exclusive-use territories. (5) Interspecific use of core areas of western tanagers and chipping sparrows (Spizella passerina, Bechstein) are compared. Core areas for chipping sparrows tended to be a larger proportion of the home range and intensity of core area use was greater for western tanagers. (6) The size and location of core areas depend on the method of determination of home range size. Alternative home range methods may have a substantial influence on the estimation of core areas due to differences in the estimated home range boundary and underlying use distribution.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses advantages and shortcomings of the S environment for multivariable geostatistics, in particular when extended with the gstat package, an extension package for the S environments (R, S-Plus). The gstat S package provides multivariable geostatistical modelling, prediction and simulation, as well as several visualisation functions. In particular, it makes the calculation, simultaneous fitting, and visualisation of a large number of direct and cross (residual) variograms very easy. Gstat was started 10 years ago and was released under the GPL in 1996; gstat.org was started in 1998. Gstat was not initially written for teaching purposes, but for research purposes, emphasising flexibility, scalability and portability. It can deal with a large number of practical issues in geostatistics, including change of support (block kriging), simple/ordinary/universal (co)kriging, fast local neighbourhood selection, flexible trend modelling, variables with different sampling configurations, and efficient simulation of large spatially correlated random fields, indicator kriging and simulation, and (directional) variogram and cross variogram modelling. The formula/models interface of the S language is used to define multivariable geostatistical models. This paper introduces the gstat S package, and discusses a number of design and implementation issues. It also draws attention to a number of papers on integration of spatial statistics software, GIS and the S environment that were presented on the spatial statistics workshop and sessions during the conference Distributed Statistical Computing 2003.},

These measurements have a spatial sampling of 10 m/pixel, a vertical accuracy of 3 to 5 m, and constitute the highest resolution, most complete, topographic data set available for the islands. Volcano heights are determined to range from 1,124 m (Sierra Negra) to 1,710 m (Wolf). Over extensive areas of each volcano, slopes exceed 25$\,^{\circ}$, with the highest slopes being ∼37$\,^{\circ}$ on Wolf and ∼36$\,^{\circ}$ on Fernandina. We confirm that two morphologic subgroups exist: Cerro Azul, Fernandina, and Wolf, with deep calderas (depth between 40--60\% of the subaerial height of the volcano) and steep (>20$\,^{\circ}$) maximum slopes at elevations between ∼60 and 80\% of the volcano height; and Alcedo, Darwin, and Sierra Negra, with shallow calderas (depth <25\% of subaerial height) and slopes that remain <15$\,^{\circ}$ until ∼90\% of the total height is reached. Our data show that steep slopes are not uniquely correlated with the occurrence of arcuate fissures at the summit, leaving the origin of the steep slopes unresolved.},

@article{Munro1996,
	abstract = {Caldera morphology on the six historically active shield volcanoes that comprise Isabela and Fernandina islands, the two westernmost islands in the Galapagos archipelago, is linked to the dynamics of magma supply to, and withdrawal from, the magma chamber beneath each volcano. Caldera size (e.g., volumes 2--9 times that of the caldera of Kilauea, Hawai'i), the absence of well-developed rift zones and the inability to sustain prolonged low-volumetric-flow-rate flank eruptions suggest that magma storage occurs predominantly within centrally located chambers (at the expense of storage within the flanks). The calderas play an important role in the formation of distinctive arcuate fissures in the central part of the volcano: repeated inward collapse of the caldera walls along with floor subsidence provide mechanisms for sustaining radially oriented least-compressive stresses that favor the formation of arcuate fissures within 1--2 km outboard of the caldera rim. Variations in caldera shape, depth-to-diameter ratio, intra-caldera bench location and the extent of talus slope development provide insight into the most recent events of caldera modification, which may be modulated by the episodic supply of magma to each volcano. A lack of correlation between the volume of the single historical collapse event and its associated volume of erupted lava precludes a model of caldera formation linked directly to magma withdrawal. Rather, caldera collapse is probably the result of accumulated loss from the central storage system without sufficient recharge and (as has been suggested for Kilauea) may be aided by the downward drag of dense cumulates and intrusives.},

@article{Geist2005,
	abstract = {{Wolf volcano, an active shield volcano on northern Isabela Island in the Gal{\'a}pagos Archipelago, has undergone two major stages of caldera collapse, with a phase of partial caldera refilling between. Wolf is a typical Gal{\'a}pagos shield volcano, with circumferential vents on the steep upper carapace and radial vents distributed in diffuse rift zones on the shallower-sloping lower flanks. The radial fissures continue into the submarine environment, where they form more tightly focused rift zones. Wolf's magmas are strikingly monotonous: estimated eruptive temperatures of the majority of lavas span a total of only 22$\,^{\circ}$C. This homogeneity is attributed to buffering of magmas as they ascend through a thick column of olivine gabbroic mush that has been deposited from a thin, shallow (\\&lt;2 km deep) subcaldera sill that is in a thermochemical steady state. Wolf's lavas have the most depleted isotopic compositions of any historically active intraplate ocean island volcano on the planet and have isotopic compositions (except for 3He/4He) indistinguishable from mid-ocean ridge basalt erupted from the Gal{\'a}pagos Spreading Center (GSC) 250--410 km away from the peak of influence of the Gal{\'a}pagos plume. Wolf's lavas are enriched in incompatible trace elements and have systematic major element differences relative to GSC lavas, however. Wolf's magmas result from lower extents of melting, deeper melt extraction, and a greater influence of garnet compared with GSC magmas, but Wolf and the GSC share the same sources. These melt generation conditions are attributed to melting in a thermal and mechanical boundary layer of depleted asthenosphere at the margins of the Gal{\'a}pagos plume. The lower degrees of melting and extraction from deeper levels result from a thicker lithospheric cap at Wolf than exists at the GSC.}},

	abstract = {As sequencing costs drop with the constant improvements in the field, next-generation sequencing becomes one of the most used technologies in biological research. Sequencing technology allows the detailed characterization of events at the molecular level, including gene expression, genomic sequence and structural variants. Such experiments result in billions of sequenced nucleotides and each one of them is associated to a quality score. Several software tools allow the quality assessment of whole experiments. However, users need to switch between software environments to perform all steps of data analysis, adding an extra layer of complexity to the data analysis workflow. We developed Rqc, a Bioconductor package designed to assist the analyst during assessment of high-throughput sequencing data quality. The package uses parallel computing strategies to optimize large data sets processing, regardless of the sequencing platform. We created new data quality visualization strategies by using established analytical procedures. That improves the ability of identifying patterns that may affect downstream procedures, including undesired sources technical variability. The software provides a framework for writing customized reports that integrates seamlessly to the R/Bioconductor environment, including publication-ready images. The package also offers an interactive tool to generate quality reports dynamically. Rqc is implemented in R and it is freely available through the Bioconductor project (https://bioconductor.org/packages/Rqc/) for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X operating systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract Estimates regarding population parameters are often based on data from surveys. To ensure that such estimates are as accurate as possible, it is important to know the detectability resulting from the particular survey method used. We used radiotelemetry to measure detectability of ornate box turtles (Terrapene ornata), using visual-encounter surveys in a sand prairie in northwestern Illinois, USA. We found that the overall detection probability of visual-encounter surveys was 0.03, and our high frequency of nondetection was due to a failure to detect visible turtles rather than turtles being underground or hidden in dense vegetation. Despite the substantial population density at our study site, visual-encounter surveys failed to detect box turtles on most visits, which resulted in a prohibitively high number of surveys that would be required to accurately estimate population size or to infer absence of the species from a site. Our method of using radiotelemetry to measure detection probability of a survey method could be easily applied to other small, cryptic, or rare species. However, our low detection probability and high frequency of nondetections recommend against use of visual-encounter surveys alone in estimating population parameters for ornate box turtles. {\copyright} 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

@article{Boback2020,
	abstract = {Abstract Transect surveys are frequently used to estimate distribution and abundance of species across a landscape, yet a proportion of individuals present will be missed because either they were out of view and unavailable for detection or they were available but not detected because the surveyors missed them. These situations lead to availability and perception bias, respectively, and can result in misleading estimates of abundance and habitat use. In this study, we examined potential biases of visual surveys used for the brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis), a cryptic invasive snake responsible for the extirpation of at least 15 vertebrates on Guam. We simultaneously executed visual surveys and radiotelemetry in a low-density population of brown tree snakes with two goals in mind: to assess the efficacy of visual surveys in detecting subjects at low densities and to identify sources of perception and availability bias in such surveys. Results indicated that with considerable effort, visual surveys can predict the presence of this cryptic reptile even at low densities (0.4 animals/ha) but perform poorly at predicting areas of high use resulting in inaccurate estimates of relative habitat importance. Telemetered snakes used densely foliated plants including Pandanus tectorius and ferns (epiphytic and terrestrial species) for nearly half of their time, yet <9\% of visual survey observations occurred in these microhabitats. Visibility of snakes decreased as they perched higher in the canopy mirroring the disparity between visual survey and telemetry detections but was also surprisingly low near the forest floor (0--1 m). Microhabitats identified in this study are likely to disproportionately affect visual surveys and would be appropriate resources to target for management purposes. When there is critical need to prevent false negatives, such as during an incipient invasion elsewhere, targeted searches of high-use resources could augment other detection tools to improve detection probabilities of this and other cryptic species.},

	abstract = {Effective and targeted conservation action requires detailed information about species, their distribution, systematics and ecology as well as the distribution of threat processes which affect them. Knowledge of reptilian diversity remains surprisingly disparate, and innovative means of gaining rapid insight into the status of reptiles are needed in order to highlight urgent conservation cases and inform environmental policy with appropriate biodiversity information in a timely manner. We present the first ever global analysis of extinction risk in reptiles, based on a random representative sample of 1500 species (16% of all currently known species). To our knowledge, our results provide the first analysis of the global conservation status and distribution patterns of reptiles and the threats affecting them, highlighting conservation priorities and knowledge gaps which need to be addressed urgently to ensure the continued survival of the world's reptiles. Nearly one in five reptilian species are threatened with extinction, with another one in five species classed as Data Deficient. The proportion of threatened reptile species is highest in freshwater environments, tropical regions and on oceanic islands, while data deficiency was highest in tropical areas, such as Central Africa and Southeast Asia, and among fossorial reptiles. Our results emphasise the need for research attention to be focussed on tropical areas which are experiencing the most dramatic rates of habitat loss, on fossorial reptiles for which there is a chronic lack of data, and on certain taxa such as snakes for which extinction risk may currently be underestimated due to lack of population information. Conservation actions specifically need to mitigate the effects of human-induced habitat loss and harvesting, which are the predominant threats to reptiles.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim Trait data are increasingly being used in studies investigating the impacts of global changes on the structure and functioning of ecological communities. Despite a growing number of trait data collations for terrestrial vertebrates, there is to date no global assessment of the gaps and biases the data present. Here, we assess whether terrestrial vertebrate trait data are taxonomically, spatially and phylogenetically biased. Location Global. Time period Present. Major taxa studied Terrestrial vertebrates. Methods We compile seven ecological traits and quantify coverage as the proportion of species for which an estimate is available. For a species, we define completeness as the proportion of non-missing values across traits. We assess whether coverage and completeness differ across classes and examine phylogenetic biases in trait data. To investigate spatial biases, we test whether wider-ranging species have more complete trait data than narrow-ranging species. Additionally, we test whether species-rich regions, which are of most concern for conservation, are less well sampled than species-poor regions. Results Mammals and birds are well sampled even in species-rich regions. For reptiles and amphibians (herptiles), only body size presents a high coverage (>80\%), in addition to habitat-related variables (amphibians). Herptiles are poorly sampled for other traits. The shortfalls are particularly acute in some species-rich regions and for certain clades. Across all classes, geographically rarer species have less complete trait information. Main conclusions Trait information is less available on average in some of the most diverse areas and in geographically rarer species, both of which crucial for biodiversity conservation. Gaps in trait data might impede our ability to conduct large-scale analyses, whereas biases can impact the validity of extrapolations. A short-term solution to the problem is to estimate missing trait data using imputation techniques, whereas a longer-term and more robust filling of existing gaps requires continued data-collection efforts.},

	abstract = {Despite its critical conservation status, no formal estimate of the Apennine brown bear ( Ursus arctos marsicanus ) distribution has ever been attempted, nor a coordinated effort to compile and verify all recent occurrences has ever been ensured. We used 48331 verified bear location data collected by qualified personnel from 2005-2014 in the central Apennines, Italy, to estimate the current distribution of Apennine brown bears. Data sources included telemetry relocations (86%), scats and DNA-verified hair samples (11.3%), sightings (1.1%), indirect signs of presence (1.1%), photos from camera traps (0.3%), and damage to properties (0.3%), both from the central and the peripheral portions of the range. Using a grid-based zonal analysis to transform raw data density, we applied ordinary kriging and estimated a 4923 km 2  main bear distribution, encompassing the historical stronghold of the bear population, and including a smaller (1460 km 2 ) area of stable occupancy of reproducing female bears. National and Regional Parks cover 40.5% of the main bear distribution, plus an additional 18% encompassed by the Natura 2000 network alone. Despite some methodological and sampling problems related to spatial and temporal variation in sampling effort at the landscape scale, our approach provides an approximation of the current bear distribution that is suited to frequently update the distribution map. Future monitoring of this bear population would benefit from estimating detectability across a range on environmental and sampling variables, and from intensifying the collection of bear presence data in the peripheral portions of the distribution.},

We used simulations to demonstrate the inconsistency of kernel estimators at determining the home-range size of random distributions. Furthermore, we used the positions of ten adult male Lampropeltis triangulum radiotracked over two full active seasons (2003 and 2004) to demonstrate that the size of the home range increases significantly with an increase in the smoothing factor. The degree of increase, however, was not consistent between individuals. In addition, using least-squares cross-validation to select the smoothing factor produced a wide range of values for different individuals. Because of these inconsistencies, we suggest using the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method to calculate home-range size in studies of herpetofauna. When studying habitat use, however, we suggest using the MCP as the area of the home range and adjusting the smoothing factor until the area of the 95% kernel equals the area of the MCP. This provides an objective method for selecting the smoothing factor.},

Up-to-date information on the area and extent of this distribution is crucial for federal, state, and tribal wildlife and land managers to make informed decisions regarding grizzly bear management. The most recent estimate of grizzly bear distribution (2004) utilized fixed-kernel density estimators to describe distribution. This method was complex and computationally time consuming and excluded observations of unmarked bears. Our objective was to develop a technique to estimate grizzly bear distribution that would allow for the use of all verified grizzly bear location data, as well as provide the simplicity to be updated more frequently. We placed all verified grizzly bear locations from all sources from 1990 to 2004 and 1990 to 2010 onto a 3-km × 3-km grid and used zonal analysis and ordinary kriging to develop a predicted surface of grizzly bear distribution. We compared the area and extent of the 2004 kriging surface with the previous 2004 effort and evaluated changes in grizzly bear distribution from 2004 to 2010. The 2004 kriging surface was 2.4\% smaller than the previous fixed-kernel estimate, but more closely represented the data. Grizzly bear distribution increased 38.3\% from 2004 to 2010, with most expansion in the northern and southern regions of the range. This technique can be used to provide a current estimate of grizzly bear distribution for management and conservation applications. {\copyright} 2013 The Wildlife Society.},

@article{Fleming2015,
	abstract = {Quantifying animals' home ranges is a key problem in ecology and has important conservation and wildlife management applications. Kernel density estimation (KDE) is a workhorse technique for range delineation problems that is both statistically efficient and nonparametric. KDE assumes that the data are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, animal tracking data, which are routinely used as inputs to KDEs, are inherently autocorrelated and violate this key assumption. As we demonstrate, using realistically autocorrelated data in conventional KDEs results in grossly underestimated home ranges. We further show that the performance of conventional KDEs actually degrades as data quality improves, because autocorrelation strength increases as movement paths become more finely resolved. To remedy these flaws with the traditional KDE method, we derive an autocorrelated KDE (AKDE) from first principles to use autocorrelated data, making it perfectly suited for movement data sets. We illustrate the vastly improved performance of AKDE using analytical arguments, relocation data from Mongolian gazelles, and simulations based upon the gazelle's observed movement process. By yielding better minimum area estimates for threatened wildlife populations, we believe that future widespread use of AKDE will have significant impact on ecology and conservation biology.},

@article{Fleming2017,
	abstract = {Summary Kernel density estimators are widely applied to area-related problems in ecology, from estimating the home range of an individual to estimating the geographic range of a species. Currently, area estimates are obtained indirectly, by first estimating the location distribution from tracking (home range) or survey (geographic range) data and then estimating areas from that distribution. This indirect approach leads to biased area estimates and difficulty in deriving reasonable confidence intervals. We introduce a new kernel density estimator (and associated confidence intervals) focused specifically on area estimation that applies to both independently sampled survey data and autocorrelated tracking data. We test our methods against simulated movement data and demonstrate its use with African buffalo data. The area-corrected kernel density estimator produces much more accurate area estimates, particularly at small sample sizes, and the newly derived confidence intervals are more reliable than existing alternatives. This new method is the most efficient nonparametric home-range estimator for animal tracking data and should also be considered when calculating nonparametric range estimates from survey data. This estimator is now the default method in the ctmm r package.},

@article{Borger2006,
	abstract = {Summary 1 Although the home range is a fundamental ecological concept, there is considerable debate over how it is best measured. There is a substantial literature concerning the precision and accuracy of all commonly used home range estimation methods; however, there has been considerably less work concerning how estimates vary with sampling regime, and how this affects statistical inferences. 2 We propose a new procedure, based on a variance components analysis using generalized mixed effects models to examine how estimates vary with sampling regime. 3 To demonstrate the method we analyse data from one study of 32 individually marked roe deer and another study of 21 individually marked kestrels. We subsampled these data to simulate increasingly less intense sampling regimes, and compared the performance of two kernel density estimation (KDE) methods, of the minimum convex polygon (MCP) and of the bivariate ellipse methods. 4 Variation between individuals and study areas contributed most to the total variance in home range size. Contrary to recent concerns over reliability, both KDE methods were remarkably efficient, robust and unbiased: 10 fixes per month, if collected over a standardized number of days, were sufficient for accurate estimates of home range size. However, the commonly used 95\% isopleth should be avoided; we recommend using isopleths between 90 and 50\%. 5 Using the same number of fixes does not guarantee unbiased home range estimates: statistical inferences differ with the number of days sampled, even if using KDE methods. 6 The MCP method was highly inefficient and results were subject to considerable and unpredictable biases. The bivariate ellipse was not the most reliable method at low sample sizes. 7 We conclude that effort should be directed at marking more individuals monitored over long periods at the expense of the sampling rate per individual. Statistical results are reliable only if the whole sampling regime is standardized. We derive practical guidelines for field studies and data analysis.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim  Various statistical techniques have been used to model species probabilities of occurrence in response to environmental conditions. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of methods and investigates whether errors in model predictions are associated to specific kinds of geographical and environmental distributions of species. Location  Portugal, Western Europe. Methods  Probabilities of occurrence for 44 species of amphibians and reptiles in Portugal were modelled using seven modelling techniques: Gower metric, Ecological Niche Factor Analysis, classification trees, neural networks, generalized linear models, generalized additive models and spatial interpolators. Generalized linear and additive models were constructed with and without a term accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Model performance was measured using two methods: sensitivity and Kappa index. Species were grouped according to their spatial (area of occupancy and extent of occurrence) and environmental (marginality and tolerance) distributions. Two-way comparison tests were performed to detect significant interactions between models and species groups. Results  Interaction between model and species groups was significant for both sensitivity and Kappa index. This indicates that model performance varied for species with different geographical and environmental distributions. Artificial neural networks performed generally better, immediately followed by generalized additive models including a covariate term for spatial autocorrelation. Non-parametric methods were preferred to parametric approaches, especially when modelling distributions of species with a greater area of occupancy, a larger extent of occurrence, lower marginality and higher tolerance. Main conclusions  This is a first attempt to relate performance of modelling techniques with species spatial and environmental distributions. Results indicate a strong relationship between model performance and the kinds of species distributions being modelled. Some methods performed generally better, but no method was superior in all circumstances. A suggestion is made that choice of the appropriate method should be contingent on the goals and kinds of distributions being modelled.},

There is increasing electronic access to vast sets of occurrence records in museums and herbaria, yet little effective guidance on how best to use this information in the context of numerous approaches for modelling distributions. To meet this need, we compared 16 modelling methods over 226 species from 6 regions of the world, creating the most comprehensive set of model comparisons to date. We used presence-only data to fit models, and independent presence-absence data to evaluate the predictions. Along with well-established modelling methods such as generalised additive models and GARP and BIOCLIM, we explored methods that either have been developed recently or have rarely been applied to modelling species' distributions. These include machine-learning methods and community models, both of which have features that may make them particularly well suited to noisy or sparse information, as is typical of species' occurrence data. Presence-only data were effective for modelling species' distributions for many species and regions. The novel methods consistently outperformed more established methods. The results of our analysis are promising for the use of data from museums and herbaria, especially as methods suited to the noise inherent in such data improve.},

@article{Guisan2000,
	abstract = {With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and GIS tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species' response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim Evaluating the relative roles of biological traits and environmental factors that predispose species to an elevated risk of extinction is of fundamental importance to macroecology. Identifying species that possess extinction-promoting traits allows targeted conservation action before precipitous declines occur. Such analyses have been carried out for several vertebrate groups, with the notable exception of reptiles. We identify traits correlating with high extinction risk in squamate reptiles, assess whether these differ with geography, taxonomy and threats, and make recommendations for future Red List assessments. Location Global. Methods We collected data on biological traits and environmental factors for a representative sample of 1139 species of squamate reptiles. We used phylogenetically controlled regression models to identify general correlates of extinction risk, threat-specific correlates of risk and realm-specific correlates of risk. We also assessed the relative importance of range size versus other factors through multiplicative bivariate models, partial regressions and variance partitioning. Results Range size was the most important predictor of extinction risk, reflecting the high frequency of reptiles assessed under range-based IUCN criteria. Habitat specialists occupying accessible ranges were at a greater risk of extinction: although these factors never contributed more than 10\% to the variance in extinction risk, they showed significant interactions with range size. The predictive power of our global models ranged from 23\% to 29\%. The general overall pattern remained the same among geographical, taxonomic and threat-specific data subsets. Main conclusions Proactive conservation requires shortcuts to identify species at high risk of extinction. Regardless of location, squamate reptiles that are range-restricted habitat specialists living in areas highly accessible to humans are likely to become extinct first. Prioritizing species that exhibit such traits could forestall extinction. Integration of data sources on human pressures, such as accessibility of species ranges, may aid robust and time-efficient assessments of species extinction risk.},

All 293 animal translocation case studies to date include a section in which the authors list the difficulties they have faced during the translocation project, with over 1200 difficulties described so far. We reviewed all difficulties reported in the series to get insights into the common perceived difficulties faced by wildlife managers during animal translocations. The most reported-upon problems had to do with animal behavior, followed by monitoring difficulties, lack of funding, quality of release habitat, lack of baseline knowledge and lack of public support. We scrutinized each of these difficulties to highlight future research directions that are most likely to improve translocation success, and put a special emphasis on difficulties stemming from animal behavior, and on solutions that may alleviate these problems and improve conservation translocation success world-wide.},

@article{Mace2008,
	abstract = {Abstract:  The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species was increasingly used during the 1980s to assess the conservation status of species for policy and planning purposes. This use stimulated the development of a new set of quantitative criteria for listing species in the categories of threat: critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable. These criteria, which were intended to be applicable to all species except microorganisms, were part of a broader system for classifying threatened species and were fully implemented by IUCN in 2000. The system and the criteria have been widely used by conservation practitioners and scientists and now underpin one indicator being used to assess the Convention on Biological Diversity 2010 biodiversity target. We describe the process and the technical background to the IUCN Red List system. The criteria refer to fundamental biological processes underlying population decline and extinction. But given major differences between species, the threatening processes affecting them, and the paucity of knowledge relating to most species, the IUCN system had to be both broad and flexible to be applicable to the majority of described species. The system was designed to measure the symptoms of extinction risk, and uses 5 independent criteria relating to aspects of population loss and decline of range size. A species is assigned to a threat category if it meets the quantitative threshold for at least one criterion. The criteria and the accompanying rules and guidelines used by IUCN are intended to increase the consistency, transparency, and validity of its categorization system, but it necessitates some compromises that affect the applicability of the system and the species lists that result. In particular, choices were made over the assessment of uncertainty, poorly known species, depleted species, population decline, restricted ranges, and rarity; all of these affect the way red lists should be viewed and used. Processes related to priority setting and the development of national red lists need to take account of some assumptions in the formulation of the criteria.},

@article{Efford2013,
	abstract = {Summary The standard spatial capture--recapture design for sampling animal populations uses a fixed array of detectors, each operated for the same time. However, methods are needed to deal with the unbalanced data that may result from unevenness of effort due to logistical constraints, partial equipment failure or pooling of data for analysis. We describe adjustments for varying effort for three types of data each with a different probability distribution for the number of observations per individual per detector per sampling occasion. A linear adjustment to the expected count is appropriate for Poisson-distributed counts (e.g. faeces per searched quadrat). A linear adjustment on the hazard scale is appropriate for binary (Bernoulli-distributed) observations at either traps or binary proximity detectors (e.g. automatic cameras). Data pooled from varying numbers of binary detectors have a binomial distribution; adjustment is achieved by varying the size parameter of the binomial. We compared a hazard-based adjustment to a more conventional covariate approach in simulations of one temporal and one spatial scenario for varying effort. The hazard-based approach was the more parsimonious and appeared more resistant to bias and confounding. We analysed a dataset comprising DNA identifications of female grizzly bears Ursus arctos sampled asynchronously with hair snares in British Columbia in 2007. Adjustment for variation in sampling interval had negligible effect on density estimates, but unmasked an apparent decline in detection probability over the season. Duration-dependent decay in sample quality is an alternative explanation for the decline that could be included in future models. Allowing for known variation in effort ensures that estimates of detection probability relate to a consistent unit of effort and improves the fit of detection models. Failure to account for varying effort may result in confounding between effort and density variation in time or space. Adjustment for effort allows rigorous analysis of unbalanced data with little extra cost in terms of precision or processing time. We suggest it should become routine in capture--recapture analyses. The methods have been made available in the R package secr.},

	abstract = {Corals and cnidarians form symbioses with dinoflagellates across a wide range of habitats from the tropics to temperate zones. Notably, these partnerships create the foundation of coral reef ecosystems and are at risk of breaking down due to climate change. This symbiosis couples the fitness of the partners, where adaptations in one species can benefit the holobiont. However, the scales over which each partner can match their current-and future-environment are largely unknown. We investigated population genetic patterns of temperate anemones (Anthopleura spp.) and their endosymbiont Breviolum 'muscatinei', across an extensive geographical range to identify the spatial scales over which local adaptation is possible. Similar to previously published results, two solitary host species exhibited isolation by distance across hundreds of kilometres. However, symbionts exhibited genetic structure across multiple spatial scales, from geographical location to depth in the intertidal zone, and host species, suggesting that symbiont populations are more likely than their hosts to adaptively mitigate the impact of increasing temperatures.},

	abstract = {Behavioural and socio-cultural traits are recognized in the restriction of gene flow in species with high cognitive capacity and complex societies. This isolation by social barriers has been generally overlooked in threatened species by assuming disrupted gene flow due to population fragmentation and decline. We examine the genetic structure and ecology of the global population of the Critically Endangered red-fronted macaw (Ara rubrogenys), an endemic species to the inter-Andean valleys of Bolivia. We found a fine-scale genetic structuring in four genetic clusters. Genetic diversity was higher in wild compared to captive-bred macaws, but similar to that of captive wild-caught macaws. We found no clear evidence of severe genetic erosion in the population in recent decades, but it was patent in historic times, overlapping with drastic human habitat transformation and macaw persecution over millennia. We found no evidence of geographical and ecological barriers, owing to the high dispersal ability, nesting and foraging habits between genetic clusters. The lack of genetic intermixing despite long-distance foraging and seasonal movements suggests recruitment in natal colonies and other social factors reinforcing philopatry-related genetic structure. Conservation efforts should be specifically focussed on major threats in each genetic cluster as independent conservation units, and also considered in ex-situ management.},

The proposed estimator is based on the Conway--Maxwell--Poisson distribution. The benefit of using the Conway--Maxwell--Poisson distribution is that it includes the Bernoulli, the Geometric and the Poisson distributions as special cases and, furthermore, allows for heterogeneity. Parameter estimates can be obtained by exploiting the ratios of successive frequency counts in a weighted linear regression framework. The results of the comparisons with Turing's, the maximum likelihood Poisson, Zelterman's and Chao's estimators reveal that our proposal can be beneficially used. Furthermore, our proposal outperforms its competitors under all heterogeneous settings. The empirical examples consider the homogeneous case and several heterogeneous cases, each with its own features, and provide interesting insights on the behavior of the estimators.},

	abstract = {Eco-evolutionary dynamics are essential in shaping the biological response of communities to ongoing climate change. Here we develop a spatially explicit eco-evolutionary framework which features more detailed species interactions, integrating evolution and dispersal. We include species interactions within and between trophic levels, and additionally, we incorporate the feature that species'interspecific competition might change due to increasing temperatures and affect the impact of climate change on ecological communities. Our modeling framework captures previously reported ecological responses to climate change, and also reveals two key results. First, interactions between trophic levels as well as temperature-dependent competition within a trophic level mitigate the negative impact of climate change on biodiversity, emphasizing the importance of understanding biotic interactions in shaping climate change impact. Second, our trait-based perspective reveals a strong positive relationship between the within-community variation in preferred temperatures and the capacity to respond to climate change. Temperature-dependent competition consistently results both in higher trait variation and more responsive communities to altered climatic conditions. Our study demonstrates the importance of species interactions in an eco-evolutionary setting, further expanding our knowledge of the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes.},

@article{Zinger2021,
	abstract = {Abstract DNA metabarcoding is becoming the tool of choice for biodiversity assessment across taxa and environments. Yet, the artefacts present in metabarcoding datasets often preclude a proper interpretation of ecological patterns. Bioinformatic pipelines to remove experimental noise exist. However, these often only partially target produced artefacts, or are marker specific. In addition, assessments of data curation quality and chosen filtering thresholds are seldom available in existing pipelines, partly due to the lack of appropriate visualisation tools. Here, we present metabaR, an r package that provides a comprehensive suite of tools to effectively curate DNA metabarcoding data after basic bioinformatic analyses. In particular, metabaR uses experimental negative or positive controls to identify different types of artefactual sequences, that is, contaminants and tag-jumps. It also flags potentially dysfunctional PCRs based on PCR replicate similarities when those are available. Finally, metabaR provides tools to visualise DNA metabarcoding data characteristics in their experimental context as well as their distribution, and facilitates assessment of the appropriateness of data curation filtering thresholds. metabaR is applicable to any DNA metabarcoding experimental design but is most powerful when the design includes experimental controls and replicates. More generally, the simplicity and flexibility of the package makes it applicable any DNA marker, and data generated with any sequencing platform, and pre-analysed with any bioinformatic pipeline. Its outputs are easily usable for downstream analyses with any ecological r package. metabaR complements existing bioinformatics pipelines by providing scientists with a variety of functions to effectively clean DNA metabarcoding data and avoid serious misinterpretations. It thus offers a promising platform for automatised data quality assessments of DNA metabarcoding data for environmental research and biomonitoring.},

	abstract = {Community-level data, the type generated by an increasing number of metabarcoding studies, is often graphed as stacked bar charts or pie graphs that use color to represent taxa. These graph types do not convey the hierarchical structure of taxonomic classifications and are limited by the use of color for categories. As an alternative, we developed metacoder, an R package for easily parsing, manipulating, and graphing publication-ready plots of hierarchical data. Metacoder includes a dynamic and flexible function that can parse most text-based formats that contain taxonomic classifications, taxon names, taxon identifiers, or sequence identifiers. Metacoder can then subset, sample, and order this parsed data using a set of intuitive functions that take into account the hierarchical nature of the data. Finally, an extremely flexible plotting function enables quantitative representation of up to 4 arbitrary statistics simultaneously in a tree format by mapping statistics to the color and size of tree nodes and edges. Metacoder also allows exploration of barcode primer bias by integrating functions to run digital PCR. Although it has been designed for data from metabarcoding research, metacoder can easily be applied to any data that has a hierarchical component such as gene ontology or geographic location data. Our package complements currently available tools for community analysis and is provided open source with an extensive online user manual.},

One of the important aspects of NGS data is its usage in early disease diagnosis especially in cancer which was earlier not possible with conventional sequencing technologies such as Sanger sequencing, NGS can identify all those mutations which cannot be identified using conventional sequencing technologies as researchers can now sequence the whole genome, exome or transcriptome. Exome sequencing is preferred, as a higher number of mutations are found to exist in the exome part of genes. The present comprehensive review encompasses the complete NGS data analysis workflow that includes alignment of NGS reads, identification and annotation of mutations and visualization, discussion of software tools for variant identification and annotation, evaluation of structural variation in NGS data, and study of different DNA sequencing technologies. In the field of clinical oncology, NGS has already proven its usefulness, and the mortality rate has been reduced, as now doctors can suggest a proper treatment to their patients by checking the complete genomic profile. However, data storage and the complexity in interpreting enormous amounts of data obtained with NGS still remain a computational challenge to researchers, as for each sample, the number of different and very large analysis files are generated directly from the raw sequence read file to the final result file. NGS resultant data is very complex, and its interpretation requires expert bioinformatics assistance, as a large number of mutations are identified from samples, but to differentiate clinically significant mutations among them with appropriate use of validation methods is a challenging task. This review is intended to provide researchers with a complete overview of NGS along with knowledge of how the tools will be employed, and insight into identification and interpretation of cancer mutations for clinical diagnostics.},

Significant advances have been made in identifying novel diseases associated mutations especially with the introduction of next generation and third generation sequencing. Regardless, some diseases are still without diagnosis as most tests rely on SNP genotyping panels developed from population based genetic analyses. Analysis of family genetic inheritance using whole genomes, whole exomes or a panel of genes has been shown to be effective in identifying disease-causing mutations.

Processing of NGS data requires multiple programs and customization of the processing pipelines according to the data platforms. However, rapid progress of the NGS applications and processing methods urgently require prompt update of the pipelines. Recent clinical applications of NGS technology such as cell-free DNA, cancer panel, or exosomal RNA sequencing data also require appropriate customization of the processing pipelines. Here, we developed SEQprocess, a highly extendable framework that can provide standard as well as customized pipelines for NGS data processing.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in genome sequencing technologies provide unprecedented opportunities to characterize individual genomic landscapes and identify mutations relevant for diagnosis and therapy. Specifically, whole-exome sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies is gaining popularity in the human genetics community due to the moderate costs, manageable data amounts and straightforward interpretation of analysis results. While whole-exome and, in the near future, whole-genome sequencing are becoming commodities, data analysis still poses significant challenges and led to the development of a plethora of tools supporting specific parts of the analysis workflow or providing a complete solution. Here, we surveyed 205 tools for whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing data analysis supporting five distinct analytical steps: quality assessment, alignment, variant identification, variant annotation and visualization. We report an overview of the functionality, features and specific requirements of the individual tools. We then selected 32 programs for variant identification, variant annotation and visualization, which were subjected to hands-on evaluation using four data sets: one set of exome data from two patients with a rare disease for testing identification of germline mutations, two cancer data sets for testing variant callers for somatic mutations, copy number variations and structural variations, and one semi-synthetic data set for testing identification of copy number variations. Our comprehensive survey and evaluation of NGS tools provides a valuable guideline for human geneticists working on Mendelian disorders, complex diseases and cancers.},

	abstract = {
            Reptiles are the most species-rich terrestrial vertebrate group with a broad diversity of life history traits. Biotelemetry is an essential methodology for studying reptiles as it compensates for several limitations when studying their natural history. We evaluated trends in terrestrial reptile spatial ecology studies focusing upon quantifying home ranges for the past twenty years. We assessed 290 English-language reptile home range studies published from 2000--2019 via a structured literature review investigating publications' study location, taxonomic group, methodology, reporting, and analytical techniques. Substantial biases remain in both location and taxonomic groups in the literature, with nearly half of all studies (45%) originating from the USA. Snakes were most often studied, and crocodiles were least often studied, while testudines tended to have the greatest within study sample sizes. More than half of all studies lacked critical methodological details, limiting the number of studies for inclusion in future meta-analyses (55% of studies lacked information on individual tracking durations, and 51% lacked sufficient information on the number of times researchers recorded positions). Studies continue to rely on outdated methods to quantify space-use (including Minimum Convex Polygons and Kernel Density Estimators), often failing to report subtleties regarding decisions that have substantial impact on home range area estimates. Moving forward researchers can select a suite of appropriate analytical techniques tailored to their research question (dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models for within sample interpolation, and autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimators for beyond sample extrapolation). Only 1.4% of all evaluated studies linked to available and usable telemetry data, further hindering scientific consensus. We ultimately implore herpetologists to adopt transparent reporting practices and make liberal use of open data platforms to maximize progress in the field of reptile spatial ecology.

However, the time has come for the conservation community to move from being technology consumers to become innovation leaders and to actively seek to create novel technologies to provide conservation tools and solutions. This challenging but critical mind-set change requires thinking outside the box to establish and support the necessary bridges between the conservation community, technologists in both the public and the private sectors, and policy makers. The ingredients already exist, but success hinges on an open mind to new types of interactions, and bold but coordinated movements to nurture the organisational ecosystem in which such collaborations can thrive and be funded.},

Compared to commercial hardware, OSH dramatically reduces participation costs. Four barriers currently hold back its wide adoption: (1) user inexperience inhibits initial uptake; (2) complex and costly manufacturing/distribution procedures impede global dissemination; (3) lack of creator support results in lapsed projects; and (4) lack of user support degrades continued utility in the field. Here, we propose a framework to address these barriers, illustrating how OSH offers a route to rapid expansion of community-driven conservation action.},

Many international borders were closed and populations were confined to their homes, which reduced transport and changed consumption patterns. Here we compile government policies and activity data to estimate the decrease in CO2 emissions during forced confinements. Daily global CO2 emissions decreased by --17{\%} (--11 to --25{\%} for $\pm$1σ) by early April 2020 compared with the mean 2019 levels, just under half from changes in surface transport. At their peak, emissions in individual countries decreased by --26{\%} on average. The impact on 2020 annual emissions depends on the duration of the confinement, with a low estimate of --4{\%} (--2 to --7{\%}) if prepandemic conditions return by mid-June, and a high estimate of --7{\%} (--3 to --13{\%}) if some restrictions remain worldwide until the end of 2020.

	abstract = {Signal ontogeny was examined in green anoles (Anolis carolinensis). From 1,246 head bob displays given by 114 juveniles, it was found that juveniles possessed all 3 display types (A, B, and C) described for adults and that C displays were present at hatching, but A and B displays appeared to emerge gradually from a common precursor. Durations of the head bobs and pauses that make up juvenile displays tended to be more variable (i.e., less stereotyped) than those of adult displays. However, within the juvenile class, sex, age (or size), social context, and rearing environment (field or lab) had no effect on display structure or stereotypy. Thus, in contrast to typical signal ontogeny in songbirds and mammals, components of the green anole signal repertoire are expressed from early development. Similar to signal ontogeny in altricial species, maturation is nevertheless important for the complete and stereotyped expression of the adult signal repertoire.},

	abstract = {We present the third high-quality genome to be determined from a Neandertal. Patterns of variation in the genome suggest that her ancestors lived in relatively isolated populations of less than 60 individuals. When we analyze this genome together with two previously sequenced Neandertal genomes, we find that genes expressed in the striatum of the brain may have changed especially much, suggesting that the striatum may have evolved unique functions in Neandertals.We sequenced the genome of a Neandertal from Chagyrskaya Cave in the Altai Mountains, Russia, to 27-fold genomic coverage. We show that this Neandertal was a female and that she was more related to Neandertals in western Eurasia [Pr{\"u}fer et al., Science 358, 655{\textendash}658 (2017); Hajdinjak et al., Nature 555, 652{\textendash}656 (2018)] than to Neandertals who lived earlier in Denisova Cave [Pr{\"u}fer et al., Nature 505, 43{\textendash}49 (2014)], which is located about 100 km away. About 12.9\% of the Chagyrskaya genome is spanned by homozygous regions that are between 2.5 and 10 centiMorgans (cM) long. This is consistent with the fact that Siberian Neandertals lived in relatively isolated populations of less than 60 individuals. In contrast, a Neandertal from Europe, a Denisovan from the Altai Mountains, and ancient modern humans seem to have lived in populations of larger sizes. The availability of three Neandertal genomes of high quality allows a view of genetic features that were unique to Neandertals and that are likely to have been at high frequency among them. We find that genes highly expressed in the striatum in the basal ganglia of the brain carry more amino-acid-changing substitutions than genes expressed elsewhere in the brain, suggesting that the striatum may have evolved unique functions in Neandertals.},

	abstract = {Objectives: We present an up-to-date review of STRUCTURE software: one of the most widely used population analysis tools that allows researchers to assess patterns of genetic structure in a set of samples. STRUCTURE can identify subsets of the whole sample by detecting allele frequency differences within the data and can assign individuals to those sub-populations based on analysis of likelihoods. The review covers STRUCTURE's most commonly used ancestry and frequency models, plus an overview of the main applications of the software in human genetics including case-control association studies (CCAS), population genetics, and forensic analysis. The review is accompanied by supplementary material providing a step-by-step guide to running STRUCTURE.Methods: With reference to a worked example, we explore the effects of changing the principal analysis parameters on STRUCTURE results when analyzing a uniform set of human genetic data. Use of the supporting software: CLUMPP and distruct is detailed and we provide an overview and worked example of STRAT software, applicable to CCAS.Conclusion: The guide offers a simplified view of how STRUCTURE, CLUMPP, distruct, and STRAT can be applied to provide researchers with an informed choice of parameter settings and supporting software when analyzing their own genetic data.},

@article{Baillargeon2007,
	abstract = {This article introduces Rcapture, an R package for capture-recapture experiments.  The data for analysis consists of the frequencies of the observable capture histories over the t capture occasions of the experiment. A capture history is a vector of zeros and ones where one stands for a capture and zero for a miss. Rcapture can fit three types of models.  With a closed population model, the goal of the analysis is to estimate the size N of the population which is assumed to be constant throughout the experiment. The estimator depends on the way in which the capture probabilities of the animals vary. Rcapture features several models for these capture probabilities that lead to different estimators for N. In an open population model, immigration and death occur between sampling periods. The estimation of survival rates is of primary interest. Rcapture can fit the basic Cormack-Jolly-Seber and Jolly-Seber model to such data. The third type of models fitted by Rcapture are robust design models. It features two levels of sampling; closed population models apply within primary periods and an open population model applies between periods. Most models in Rcapture have a loglinear form; they are fitted by carrying out a Poisson regression with the R function glm. Estimates of the demographic parameters of interest are derived from the loglinear parameter estimates; their variances are obtained by linearization. The novel feature of this package is the provision of several new options for modeling capture probabilities heterogeneity between animals in both closed population models and the primary periods of a robust design. It also implements many of the techniques developed by R. M. Cormack for open population models.},

	abstract = {Hybridization has many and varied impacts on the process of speciation. Hybridization may slow or reverse differentiation by allowing gene flow and recombination. It may accelerate speciation via adaptive introgression or cause near-instantaneous speciation by allopolyploidization. It may have multiple effects at different stages and in different spatial contexts within a single speciation event. We offer a perspective on the context and evolutionary significance of hybridization during speciation, highlighting issues of current interest and debate. In secondary contact zones, it is uncertain if barriers to gene flow will be strengthened or broken down due to recombination and gene flow. Theory and empirical evidence suggest the latter is more likely, except within and around strongly selected genomic regions. Hybridization may contribute to speciation through the formation of new hybrid taxa, whereas introgression of a few loci may promote adaptive divergence and so facilitate speciation. Gene regulatory networks, epigenetic effects and the evolution of selfish genetic material in the genome suggest that the Dobzhansky-Muller model of hybrid incompatibilities requires a broader interpretation. Finally, although the incidence of reinforcement remains uncertain, this and other interactions in areas of sympatry may have knock-on effects on speciation both within and outside regions of hybridization.},

	abstract = {Theory and empirical evidence show that intraspecific competition can drive selection favouring the use of novel resources (i.e. niche expansion). The evolutionary response to such selection depends on genetic variation for resource use. However, while genetic variation might facilitate niche expansion, genetically diverse groups may also experience weaker competition, reducing density-dependent selection on resource use. Therefore, genetic variation for fitness on different resources could directly facilitate, or indirectly retard, niche expansion. To test these alternatives, we factorially manipulated both the degree of genetic variation and population density in flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum) exposed to both novel and familiar food resources. Using stable carbon isotope analysis, we measured temporal change and individual variation in beetle diet across eight generations. Intraspecific competition and genetic variation acted on different components of niche evolution: competition facilitated niche expansion, while genetic variation increased individual variation in niche use. In addition, genetic variation and competition together facilitated niche expansion, but all these impacts were temporally variable. Thus, we show that the interaction between genetic variation and competition can also determine niche evolution at different time scales.},

	abstract = {Population structure can dramatically alter mutation load, but the magnitude and direction of this effect depend on whether selection is soft or hard. The abstract nature of previous load models obscured the importance of ecological details in determining the softness of selection. Under the more ecologically explicit model used here, I show that genes related to intrinsic growth rate tend to experience hard selection whereas those genes affecting competitive ability experience softer selection. Although resource limitation determines the strength of selection on competitive ability, it only affects the softness of selection, and thus the load, of mutations with pleiotropic effects on intrinsic growth rate. While competition is typically considered necessary for soft selection, the model shows that interspecific competition hardens selection and can thereby lead to reduced load. Finally, genetic variation in the consumption rates of individuals who die before reproduction can cause supersoft selection, resulting in large increases in load. The same conditions that increase mutation load also increase inbreeding depression.},

	abstract = {Many multicellular eukaryotes have reasonably high per-generation mutation rates. Consequently, most populations harbor an abundance of segregating deleterious alleles. These alleles, most of which are of small effect individually, collectively can reduce substantially the fitness of individuals relative to what it would be otherwise; this is mutation load. Mutation load can be lessened by any factor that causes more mutations to be removed per selective death, such as inbreeding, synergistic epistasis, population structure, or harsh environments. The ecological effects of load are not clear-cut because some conditions (such as selection early in life, sexual selection, reproductive compensation, and intraspecific competition) reduce the effects of load on population size and persistence, but other conditions (such as interspecific competition and load on resource use efficiency) can cause small amounts of load to have strong effects on the population, even extinction.

	abstract = {There is compelling evidence about the manifest effects of inbreeding depression on individual fitness and populations' risk of extinction. The majority of studies addressing inbreeding depression on wild populations are generally based on indirect measures of inbreeding using neutral markers. However, the study of functional loci, such as genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), is highly recommended. MHC genes constitute an essential component of the immune system of individuals, which is directly related to individual fitness and survival. In this study, we analyse heterozygosity fitness correlations of neutral and adaptive genetic variation (22 microsatellite loci and two loci of the MHC class II, respectively) with the age of recruitment and breeding success of a decimated and geographically isolated population of a long-lived territorial vulture. Our results indicate a negative correlation between neutral genetic diversity and age of recruitment, suggesting that inbreeding may be delaying reproduction. We also found a positive correlation between functional (MHC) genetic diversity and breeding success, together with a specific positive effect of the most frequent pair of cosegregating MHC alleles in the population. Globally, our findings demonstrate that genetic depauperation in small populations has a negative impact on the individual fitness, thus increasing the populations' extinction risk.},

	abstract = {Wherever wildlife management concerns the movement of individuals across structured habitat, its scale of operations will encompass metapopulation dynamics. The goal of this chapter is to review the potential applications of metapopulation concepts and models in reserve design and conservation management. Our perspective is forward-looking. We show how some key problems of where to direct conservation effort and how to manage populations can be addressed in the context of regional habitat structure and the survival and renewal of habitat patches. We also mention several cases of successful metapopulation management and point out practical problems. We emphasise (1) that the viability of a population may depend on surrounding populations, in which case metapopulation processes influence or determine reserve design and management options; (2) that understanding the dynamic processes requires models, which make assumptions that need validating; (3) that the principle limitation of metapopulation models is their single-species focus. Conservation strategies clearly depend on the particular social, economic and ecological circumstances of each region, and concepts such as the metapopulation can seem irrelevant to practical concerns. We aim to show, nevertheless, that an understanding of metapopulation dynamics can be vital to asking pertinent questions and seeking potential solutions. The conceptual framework of metapopulation dynamics tells us what information is needed in order to build case-specific models relevant to any of a wide range of issues. These issues include the potential disadvantages of habitat corridors, or hidden benefits of sink habitat; the optimal schedule for translocations or reintroductions; the relative merits of reducing local extinctions against increasing colonisations; the optimum distribution of habitat improvement; and the advantages of increasing life spans of ephemeral habitats.},

Electrophoretic and proton NMR studies indicated that the secretions are composed of approximately 80 {\%} protein and 20{\%} lipid material. Individual differences in polyacrylamide gel banding patterns of femoral gland proteins were found. Reflectance spectroscopy revealed that the secretions strongly absorb longwave ultraviolet light, a feature that may be important in the localization of secretion deposits in the environment.},

	abstract = {In small, insular populations, behavioral patterns that lead to increased variance in individual reproductive success can accelerate loss of genetic variation. Over a 1-year period, we documented behavior and hormone levels in a breeding group of adult Cuban iguanas (Cyclura nubila) at Guantanamo Bay. Male dominance was associated with body and head size, display behavior, testosterone levels, home-range size, and proximity to females. Based on their success in agonistic encounters. we ranked males in a linear dominance hierarchy. During the subsequent breeding season, we conducted a removal experiment in which the five highest-ranking males were temporarily relocated from the study site. Although we were unable to assess reproductive success directly, previously lower-ranking males assumed control of vacated territories. won more fights, and increased their proximity to females in the absence of the dominant males. When it results in greater mating opportunities for otherwise socially suppressed individuals, temporary alteration of local social structure may help limit erosion of genetic variation in small, insular populations.},

Similarity coefficients reflecting the degree of band sharing between pairs of individuals were calculated to investigate variability in femoral gland proteins at the individual, familial, and population levels. Although all iguanas examined shared many protein bands, no two individuals possessed identical banding patterns. Similarity coefficients were higher within than between populations, indicating a genetic basis for variation in femoral gland proteins. In juveniles, protein composition was more similar within than between the sexes. Furthermore, among both male and female juveniles, more protein bands were shared within than among clutches. These results suggest that, if differences in protein composition are detected by green iguanas, femoral gland secretions could communicate information useful in conspecific, sex, and kin recognition.},

	abstract = {Social and hormonal correlates of femoral gland productivity were investigated in groups of adult and juvenile green iguanas (Iguana iguana) over 12 months. Femoral gland productivity, pore size, and the percentage of lipids in the secretions were correlated with plasma testosterone (T) levels in dominant, although not in subordinate, adult males. Secretory activity peaked during the breeding months, at which time dominants produced more secretion than subordinates. Pore size in juvenile males was positively correlated with plasma T levels and frequency of headbob displays in the months corresponding to the adult breeding season. After 18 months of age, individuals that performed visual displays had significantly larger pores than individuals that did not display. These results indicate that femoral gland secretions could function in the ontogeny and maintenance of dominance relationships. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

	abstract = {Abstract In this study, we examine the effects of habitat fragmentation on the genetic structure of the Cantabrian capercaillie Tetrao urogallus cantabricus, based on eight microsatellite loci in non-invasive samples collected across its entire distribu- tion range in northern Spain. For this purpose, we used Bayesian clustering methods and landscape connectivity analyses. We found low genetic diversity and significant genetic differentiation across the subspecies distribution range. Based on the isolation-by-distance pattern observed, we hypothesized that the low dispersal of the species and the habitat configuration might be shaping the genetic structure of Cantabrian capercaillie, and cause reduced gene flow and diversity of some areas. Three genetic clusters were inferred, one in the northern and two in the southern slope of the Cantabrian Mountains. Our results suggest that small but abundant forest patches on the northern slope of the Cantabrian range do not seem to represent a barrier to gene flow, whereas the more isolated forests in the southern Cantabrian Mountains do represent such a barrier. This result was not concordant with the structure proposed based on lek occupation patterns. Conservation strategies should include restoration of forest connectivity to the extent possible.},

	abstract = {The evolution of the amniotic egg was one of the great evolutionary innovations in the history of life, freeing vertebrates from an obligatory connection to water and thus permitting the conquest of terrestrial environments. Among amniotes, genome sequences are available for mammals and birds, but not for non-avian reptiles. Here we report the genome sequence of the North American green anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis. We find that A. carolinensis microchromosomes are highly syntenic with chicken microchromosomes, yet do not exhibit the high GC and low repeat content that are characteristic of avian microchromosomes. Also, A. carolinensis mobile elements are very young and diverse-more so than in any other sequenced amniote genome. The GC content of this lizard genome is also unusual in its homogeneity, unlike the regionally variable GC content found in mammals and birds. We describe and assign sequence to the previously unknown A. carolinensis X chromosome. Comparative gene analysis shows that amniote egg proteins have evolved significantly more rapidly than other proteins. An anole phylogeny resolves basal branches to illuminate the history of their repeated adaptive radiations.},

Traditionally it has been measured as individual inbreeding coefficient calculated from the pedigree, but recently multilocus heterozygosity estimates have become commonly used as proxies. However, theoretical and simulation studies have cast doubt on the validity of these surrogates especially when they are based on only a few molecular markers. Yet, empirical studies reporting the correlation between multilocus heterozygosity and inbreeding coefficient are rare. We studied this relationship in a wild Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus) population subject to a long-term field study over 30 years. The correlations between inbreeding coefficient and the employed heterozygosity measures-standardized heterozygosity and internal relatedness-based on 21 microsatellite loci were weak. These results together with results from theoretical and simulation studies caution against use of multilocus heterozygosity estimates to study inbreeding in natural populations.},

Before using multilocus heterozygosity estimates in studies of inbreeding, their ability to capture information on inbreeding in the given setting should be tested. A convenient method for this is to compute the heterozygosity-heterozygosity correlation, i.e. the mean correlation between multilocus heterozygosity estimates calculated from random samples of loci, which should be positive if multilocus heterozygosity carries a signature of inbreeding. Rhh is an extension package for the statistical software r that estimates this correlation and calculates three measures of individual multilocus heterozygosity: homozygosity by loci, internal relatedness and standardized heterozygosity.

	abstract = {Aim: We constructed a series of high-resolution palaeogeographical models for the Gal{\'{a}}pagos archipelago for the last 700 kyr, accommodating thermal subsidence of the islands, eustatic sea-level change, and associated sea-floor loading. We assessed the possible impacts of these changes for the terrestrial fauna. Location: The Gal{\'{a}}pagos Islands. Methods: Palaeogeographical modelling and evaluation of biogeographical distributions. Results: Since 700 ka, sea levels broadly similar to those today isolated the various Gal{\'{a}}pagos islands for intervals of c. 90 kyr. Intervening 5-10 kyr periods of extreme lowstands in sea level (-140 to -210 m) dramatically changed the central and western archipelago, with several large islands, plus their satellites, coalescing. During the several connection episodes the land-locked vertebrates had significant or complete access to all of the newly exposed terrain. Analysis of the biological data suggests that these physical processes left detectable imprints on the biogeography of groups including racer snakes, lava lizards, land iguanas and leaf-toed geckos. Main conclusions: In the recent geological past, a sizeable region within the Gal{\'{a}}pagos chain must have experienced rapid, significant changes in its geography as a result of major shifts in local relative sea level periodically connecting and then isolating islands. This might explain striking patterns in the distribution and composition of the archipelago's land fauna. These insights provide a platform for future studies predicting the ages of subpopulation separations, which should correspond to the sea-level rises that followed each of the lows. The oscillating geography mechanism described herein may provide a new lens to view biological evolution on a number of other island chains, including the Maldives, the Canaries and Cape Verde. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {1. A comprehensive analysis was carried out on the effects of stocking on the genetic structure of Iberian brown trout evolutionary lineages. Introgression and genetic diversity were estimated from allozyme results of 307 populations based on own data (180) and available literature (127). Stocking records, angling regulations and environmental features related to hatchery trout performance were also analysed to determine the underlying mechanisms of the introgression effects. 2. Fifty per cent of analysed populations showed introgression by genes of hatchery origin. The mean introgression estimated by the single locus approach inline image was 0.134. An increment of both heterozygosity and polymorphism was observed when introgression increased in stream-dwelling populations, which could finally produce a homogenisation of the genetic structure of populations and a decrease of the species' genetic diversity. 3. Introgression rate varied among Iberian evolutionary lineages (Evolutionary Significant Units), and was correlated with the stocking effort, except for the North Atlantic basins. The lack of adaptations for migratory behaviour in hatchery trout could explain the low impact of stocking in North Atlantic rivers where anadromous populations occur. 4. Angling regulation did not seem to influence the survival of hatchery trout. Introgression tends to be higher in heavily stocked localities with fertile waters and stable discharge, which may favour the performance of hatchery trout. 5. Trout management must be based on increasing population size by means of habitat improvement and sustainability of naturally reproducing wild stocks through appropriate angling regulations.},

	abstract = {Coevolutionary diversification is cited as a major mechanism driving the evolution of diversity, particularly in plants and insects. However, tests of coevolutionary diversification have focused on elucidating macroevolutionary patterns rather than the processes giving rise to such patterns. Hence, there is weak evidence that coevolution promotes diversification. This is in part due to a lack of understanding about the mechanisms by which coevolution can cause speciation and the difficulty of integrating results across micro- and macroevolutionary scales. In this review, we highlight potential mechanisms of coevolutionary diversification, outline approaches to examine this process across temporal scales, and propose a set of minimal requirements for demonstrating coevolutionary diversification. Our aim is to stimulate research that tests more rigorously for coevolutionary diversification. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Recent studies of parasitoid-host interactions have demonstrated that parasitoids and their hosts are geographically structured for traits such as virulence and encapsulation defenses, but no studies have yet compared the geographic structure of parasitoids and hosts using neutral genetic markers. Such studies of geographic structure are needed to evaluate the underlying geographic scale at which these interactions evolve and allow assessment of the relative effects of selection and gene flow on the geographic structure observed in traits under selection. We used sequence data from the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I and II subunits to document and compare the geographic structures of the parasitoid Agathis thompsoni and its moth host Greya subalba. We also documented the geographic structure of G. enchrysa and compared it to the geographic structure of its parasitoid Agathis n. sp. The results demonstrated that parasitoids and their hosts may have incongruent patterns of geographic structure as assessed by molecular markers. As a consequence, the geographic scale at which the interaction evolves may be different for each species involved in the interaction. Depending on the interplay of selection and gene flow, there may not be a one-to-one correspondence of traits important in the interaction between parasitoids and their hosts at the level of local populations. The geographic structures of A. thompsoni and G. subalba and Agathis n. sp. and G, enchrysa provide further evidence of the potential importance of the formation of geographic mosaics in coevolving parasitoid-host interactions and evolving interactions in general.},

The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Membrane proteins constitute a significant fraction of the proteome and are important drug targets. While the transmembrane (TM) segments of these proteins are primarily composed of hydrophobic residues, the inclusion of polar residues - either naturally occurring or as a consequence of a disease-related mutation - places a significant folding burden in this environment, potentially impacting bilayer insertion and/or association of neighboring TM helices. Here we investigate the role of an anionic detergent, sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), and a zwitterionic detergent, dodecylphosphocholine (DPC), in the folding process, and the effects induced by a single polar substitution, on structure and topology of model $\alpha$-helical TM segments. The peptides, represented by KK-YAAAIAAIAWAXAAIAAAIAA-KKK-NH2, where X is I or N, are designed with high aqueous solubilities, through poly-lysine tags. Circular dichroism (CD) and NMR were used to monitor peptide secondary structure and diffusional mobility of both peptide and the detergent hosts. For both peptides, SDS binding commenced at a concentration below its CMC, due to Coulombic attraction of anionic SDS to cationic Lys residues. Increasing SDS binding correlated with increasing peptide helicity. Pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR diffusion measurements revealed that the Asn-containing peptide bound four fewer detergent molecules, corresponding to ca. 20{\%} less SDS than bound by the Ile peptide. Conversely, zwitterionic DPC binding to either peptide was not observed until the DPC concentration approached its CMC. Our findings confirm quantitatively that a single polar residue within a TM segment may have a significant influence on its local membrane environment. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Group size in both multicellular organisms and animal societies can correlate with the degree of division of labour. For ants, the task specialization hypothesis (TSH) proposes that increased behavioural specialization enabled by larger group size corresponds to anatomical specialization of worker brains. Alternatively, the social brain hypothesis proposes that increased levels of social stimuli in larger colonies lead to enlarged brain regions in all workers, regardless of their task specialization. We tested these hypotheses in acacia ants (Pseudomyrmex spinicola), which exhibit behavioural but not morphological task specialization. In wild colonies, we marked, followed and tested ant workers involved in foraging tasks on the leaves (leaf-ants) and in defensive tasks on the host tree trunk (trunk-ants). Task specialization increased with colony size, especially in defensive tasks. The relationship between colony size and brain region volume was task-dependent, supporting the TSH. Specifically, as colony size increased, the relative size of regions within the mushroom bodies of the brain decreased in trunk-ants but increased in leaf-ants; those regions play important roles in learning and memory. Our findings suggest that workers specialized in defence may have reduced learning abilities relative to leaf-ants; these inferences remain to be tested. In societies with monomorphic workers, brain polymorphism enhanced by group size could be a mechanism by which division of labour is achieved.},

	abstract = {The blue land crab Cardisoma guanhumi is widely distributed throughout tropical and subtropical estuarine regions in the Western Central Atlantic (WCA). Patterns of population genetic structure and historical demographics of the species were assessed by mtDNA control region sequence analysis to examine the connectivity among five populations (n = 97) within the region for future conservation strategies and decision-making of fishery management. A total of 234 polymorphic nucleotides were revealed within the sequence region, which have defined 93 distinct haplotypes. No dominant mtDNA haplotypes were found but instead a distribution of a few low-frequency recurrent haplotypes with a large number of singletons. A NJ-tree and a median-joining haplotype network revealed two distinct clusters, corresponding to individuals from estuaries located along the Caribbean Sea and Brazilian waters, respectively. AMOVA and FST statistics supported the hypothesis that two main geographic regions exists. Phylogeographical discontinuity was further demonstrated by the Bayesian assignment analysis and a significant pattern of isolation-by-distance. Additionally, tests of neutral evolution and analysis of mismatch distribution indicate a complex demographic history in the WCA, which corresponds to bottleneck and subsequent population growth. Overall, a sharp genetic break between Caribbean and Brazilian populations raised concerns over the conservation status of the blue land crab.},

	abstract = {Whole genome sequencing of families of Arabidopsis has recently lent strong support to the heterozygote instability (HI) hypothesis that heterozygosity locally increases mutation rate. However, there is an important theoretical difference between the impact on base substitutions, where mutation rate increases in regions surrounding a heterozygous site, and the impact of HI on sequences such as microsatellites, where mutations are likely to occur at the heterozygous site itself. At microsatellite loci, HI should create a positive feedback loop, with heterozygosity and mutation rate mutually increasing each other. Direct support for HI acting on microsatellites is limited and con- tradictory. I therefore analysed AC microsatellites in 1163 genome sequences from the 1000 genomes project. I used the presence of rare alleles, which are likely to be very recent in origin, as a surrogate measure of mutation rate. I show that rare alleles are more likely to occur at locus-population combi- nations with higher heterozygosity even when all populations carry exactly the same number of alleles.},

@article{Amos2014,
	abstract = {Substitution rate is often found to correlate with life history traits such as body mass, a predictor of population size and longevity, and body temperature. The underlying mechanism is unclear but most models invoke either natural selection or factors such as generation length that change the number of mutation opportunities per unit time. Here we use published genome sequences from 69 mammals to ask whether life history traits impact another form of genetic mutation, the high rates of predominantly neutral slippage in microsatellites. We find that the length-frequency distributions of three common dinucleotide motifs differ greatly between even closely related species. These frequency differences correlate with body mass and body temperature and can be used to predict the phenotype of an unknown species. Importantly, different length microsatellites show complicated patterns of excess and deficit that cannot be explained by a simple model where species with short generation lengths have experienced more mutations. Instead, the patterns probably require changes in mutation rate that impact alleles of different length to different extents. Body temperature plausibly influences mutation rate by modulating the propensity for slippage. Existing hypotheses struggle to account for a link between body mass and mutation rate. However, body mass correlates inversely with population size, which in turn predicts heterozygosity. We suggest that heterozygote instability, HI, the idea that heterozygous sites show increased mutability, could provide a plausible link between body mass and mutation rate.},

@article{Amos2010,
	abstract = {There is a strong consensus that modern humans originated in Africa and moved out to colonize the world approximately 50 000 years ago. During the process of expansion, variability was lost, creating a linear gradient of decreasing diversity with increasing distance from Africa. However, the exact way in which this loss occurred remains somewhat unclear: did it involve one, a few or a continuous series of population bottlenecks? We addressed this by analysing a large published dataset of 783 microsatellite loci genotyped in 53 worldwide populations, using the program 'Bottleneck'. Immediately following a sharp population decline, rare alleles are lost faster than heterozygosity, creating a transient excess of heterozygosity relative to allele number, a feature that is used by Bottleneck to infer historical events. We find evidence of two primary events, one 'out of Africa' and one placed around the Bering Strait, where an ancient land bridge allowed passage into the Americas. These findings agree well with the regions of the world where the largest founder events might have been expected, but contrast with the apparently smooth gradient of variability that is revealed when current heterozygosity is plotted against distance from Africa.},

@article{Amos2007,
	abstract = {As genotyping methods move ever closer to full automation, care must be taken to ensure that there is no equivalent rise in allele-calling error rates. One clear source of error lies with how raw allele lengths are converted into allele classes, a process referred to as binning. Standard automated approaches usually assume collinearity between expected and measured fragment length. Unfortunately, such collinearity is often only approximate, with the consequence that alleles do not conform to a perfect 2-, 3- or 4-base-pair periodicity. To account for these problems, we introduce a method that allows repeat units to be fractionally shorter or longer than their theoretical value. Tested on a large human data set, our algorithm performs well over a wide range of dinucleotide repeat loci. The size of the problem caused by sticking to whole numbers of bases is indicated by the fact that the effective repeat length was within 5{\%} of the assumed length only 68.3{\%} of the time.},

@article{Amos2001,
	abstract = {The relationship between fitness and parental similarity has been dominated by studies of how inbreeding depression lowers fecundity in incestuous matings. A widespread implicit assumption is that adult fitness (reproduction) of individuals born to parents who are not unusually closely related is more or less equal. Examination of three long-lived vertebrates, the long-finned pilot whale, the grey seal and the wandering albatross reveals significant negative relationships between parental similarity and genetic estimates of reproductive success. This effect could, in principle, be driven by a small number of low quality, inbred individuals. However, when the data are partitioned into individuals with above average and below average parental similarity, we find no evidence that the slopes differ, suggesting that the effect is more or less similar across the full range of parental similarity values. Our results thus uncover a selective pressure that favours not only inbreeding avoidance, but also the selection of maximally dissimilar mates.},

	abstract = {The ADXL345 is a small, thin, ultralow power, 3-axis accelerometer with high resolution (13-bit) measurement at up to $\pm$16 g. Digital output data is formatted as 16-bit twos complement and is acces- sible through either a SPI (3- or 4-wire) or I2 C digital interface. The ADXL345 is well suited for mobile device applications. It measures the static acceleration of gravity in tilt-sensing appli- cations, as well as dynamic acceleration resulting from motion or shock. Its high resolution (3.9 mg/LSB) enables measurement of inclination changes less than 1.0$\,^{\circ}$. Several special sensing functions are provided. Activity and inactivity sensing detect the presence or lack of motion by comparing the acceleration on any axis with user-set thresholds. Tap sensing detects single and double taps in any direction. Free- fall sensing detects if the device is falling. These functions can be mapped individually to either of two interrupt output pins. An integrated memory management system with a 32-level first in, first out (FIFO) buffer can be used to store data to minimize host processor activity and lower overall system power consumption. Low power modes enable intelligent motion-based power management with threshold sensing and active acceleration measurement at extremely low power dissipation},

	abstract = {RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been rapidly adopted for the profiling of transcriptomes in many areas of biology, including studies into gene regulation, development and disease. Of particular interest is the discovery of differentially expressed genes across different conditions (e.g., tissues, perturbations), while optionally adjusting for other systematic factors that affect the data collection process. There are a number of subtle yet critical aspects of these analyses, such as read counting, appropriate treatment of biological variability, quality control checks and appropriate setup of statistical modeling. Several variations have been presented in the literature, and there is a need for guidance on current best practices. This protocol presents a "state-of-the-art" computational and statistical RNA-seq differential expression analysis workflow largely based on the free open-source R language and Bioconductor software and in particular, two widely-used tools DESeq and edgeR.

Little is known about the population genomic and evolutionary history of this species. We characterized C. elegans genetic variation using high-throughput selective sequencing of a worldwide collection of 200 wild strains and identified 41,188 SNPs. Notably, C. elegans genome variation is dominated by a set of commonly shared haplotypes on four of its six chromosomes, each spanning many megabases. Population genetic modeling showed that this pattern was generated by chromosome-scale selective sweeps that have reduced variation worldwide; at least one of these sweeps probably occurred in the last few hundred years. These sweeps, which we hypothesize to be a result of human activity, have drastically reshaped the global C. elegans population in the recent past.},

	abstract = {Microcrustaceans are abundant in many freshwater wetlands, including forested floodplain swamps, but little has been done to assess their secondary production and functional role in these systems. Since standard cohort approaches to estimating secondary production are impossible with continuously growing and reproducing microcrustaceans, it is necessary to obtain independent determinations of their growth and reproductive characteristics under environmental conditions encountered in their natural habitat throughout the year. The growth and reproduction of Ceriodaphnia dubia fed natural swamp seston were measured at 10, 15, 20, and 25 degrees C-temperatures which span much of the annual temperature range in southeastern floodplain swamps. Somatic biomass growth rates were as high as 61{\%} d(-1). Total growth rates (somatic tissue and egg mass) reached 95{\%} d(-1). Both somatic growth rates and total growth rates could be described as functions of individual size and temperature. High egg production, particularly in the larger instars, resulted in individuals maintaining high total growth rates ({\textgreater}20{\%} d(-1) at most temperatures) over the lifespan. Lifetime egg production accounted for {\textgreater}50{\%} of biomass produced by individuals at all temperatures and {\textgreater}80{\%} for temperatures greater than or equal to 20 degrees C. Somatic growth rates for C. dubia fed swamp seston were within the range of literature estimates for other species of Ceriodaphnia under various food conditions},

	abstract = {NewHybrids is a program for computing the posterior distribution that individuals in a sample fall into different hybrid categories. The details of the algorithm are published in Anderson and Thompson (2002). This document describes how to use the program. In order to make the program accessible to researchers,and also for my own use of the program,I have created a graphical interface that allows the observation of most of the variables involved in the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. This is valuable for assessing the reliability of the results from the MCMC run. In order to take full advantage of these features, you will want to read A User's Guide to the GLUT for Markov Chain Monte Carlo Graphical Interface which is included in the standard distribution of the NewHybrids software as the file GFMCMC UserGuide.pdf. If you are like me,y ou will find it nice to start using the software immediately. For this reason,I have included a test data file and describe how to get the program running on that as quickly as possible in the ``Quick Start'' section (page 3). After that I go into more detail on the required data file format,program options,and the graphical features unique to NewHybrids. This version (1.1 beta) is a pre-distributed version. The added features in this version are: * Support and documentation for dominant markers like AFLP's (Section 3.2) There is currently nothing published in the scientific white literature on this,but I hope to have something published soon. * The ability to specify,via the z and the s options,individuals of known hybrid category that may or may not be considered part of the mixture of interest. (Section 3.4) * A simple way to change between a Jeffreys-type prior and uniform prior for $\pi$ or $\Theta$. This can be done during run-time in the graphical version to gauge the sensitivity of the analysis to these two different types of reasonable ``not-too-terribly informative'' priors (Section 3.5). * The program now reports the alleles read in at each locus in the output file ``aa-LociAndAlleles.txt''. This allows the user to know which allele index in the program corresponds to which allele name in the data file. In the program,alleles get numbered sequentially starting at 0. The order of the alleles is given in ``aa-LociAndAlleles.txt''. * A method for placing priors on the allele frequencies in the separate species that does not require the genotypes of all previously sampled individuals (Section 3.5.1). * A non-graphical version of the program. For very large data sets or for long runs,it may be preferable to not run NewHybrids with all the graphical interface. This distribution now includes a graphics free version that does not require any of the graphics libraries that the other version requires. It still lacks some features that I hope to add to the software soon. A further shortcoming is that I am not yet retaining (in a user-accessible way) the codes given to different alleles in the data set. Within the program,alleles get numbered internally from 0 to the the number of alleles at the locus minus one,but that internal numbering system may correspond in a mysterious fashion to how the alleles are numbered in your dataset. I will address these issues in a later version. There are bound to be some bugs in the program. I have developed it under the Mac Operating System,but have ported it to Windows. Since I don't have a real Windows machine at my disposal,I have not been able to test the program extensively in that environment. Please be patient! And don't hesitate to send me email,or call me at my office: (510) 643-6299.},

Subsequently, an extensive series of simulations of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) data is performed to evaluate the prospects for hybrid identification with (possibly non-diagnostic) dominant markers. Distinguishing between F's and F's is shown to be difficult, possibly requiring upwards of 100 AFLP markers to be done accurately. Discriminating between pure-bred and non-pure (hybrid) individuals, however, is shown to be much easier, requiring perhaps as few as 10 dominant markers, even from relatively weakly diverged species.},

The method does not require that allele frequencies be known in the parental species nor that separate, pure samples of the parental species be available. The method is suitable for both markers with fixed allelic differences between the species and markers without fixed differences. The probability model used is one in which parentals and various classes of hybrids (F(1)'s, F(2)'s, and various backcrosses) form a mixture from which the sample is drawn. Using the framework of Bayesian model-based clustering allows us to compute, by Markov chain Monte Carlo, the posterior probability that each individual belongs to each of the distinct hybrid classes. We demonstrate the method on allozyme data from two species of hybridizing trout, as well as on two simulated data sets.},

	abstract = {The traditional likelihood-based test for differences in multivariate dispersions is known to be sensitive to nonnormality. It is also impossible to use when the number of variables exceeds the number of observations. Many biological and ecological data sets have many variables, are highly skewed, and are zero-inflated. The traditional test and even some more robust alternatives are also unreasonable in many contexts where measures of dispersion based on a non-Euclidean dissimilarity would be more appropriate. Distance-based tests of homogeneity of multivariate dispersions, which can be based on any dissimilarity measure of choice, are proposed here. They rely on the rotational invariance of either the multivariate centroid or the spatial median to obtain measures of spread using principal coordinate axes. The tests are straightforward multivariate extensions of Levene's test, with P-values obtained either using the traditional F-distribution or using permutation of either least-squares or LAD residuals. Examples illustrate the utility of the approach, including the analysis of stabilizing selection in sparrows, biodiversity of New Zealand fish assemblages, and the response of Indonesian reef corals to an El Ni{\~{n}}o. Monte Carlo simulations from the real data sets show that the distance-based tests are robust and powerful for relevant alternative hypotheses of real differences in spread. {\textcopyright} 2005, The International Biometric Society.},

This genome contains 834 protein-coding genes. The functional profiles of these genes show similarities to those of mitochondrial genes: no genes required for anaerobic glycolysis are found in either R. prowazekii or mitochondrial genomes, but a complete set of genes encoding components of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the respiratory-chain complex is found in R. prowazekii. In effect, ATP production in Rickettsia is the same as that in mitochondria. Many genes involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of biosynthesis of amino acids and nucleosides in free-living bacteria are absent from R. prowazekii and mitochondria. Such genes seem to have been replaced by homologues in the nuclear (host) genome. The R. prowazekii genome contains the highest proportion of non-coding DNA (24{\%}) detected so far in a microbial genome. Such non-coding sequences may be degraded remnants of 'neutralized' genes that await elimination from the genome. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that R. prowazekii is more closely related to mitochondria than is any other microbe studied so far.},

	abstract = {Very high-resolution (VHR) image data, including from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms, are increasingly acquired for wildlife surveys. Animals or structures they build (e.g. nests) can be photointerpreted from these images, how-ever, automated detection is required for more efficient surveys. We developed semi-automated analyses to map white-bellied sea eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster) nests in VHR aerial photographs of the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, Western Aus-tralia, an important breeding site for many seabird species. Nest detection is com-plicated by high environmental heterogeneity at the scale of nests ({\~{}}1--2 m), the presence of many features that resemble nests and the variability of nest size, shape and context. Finally, the rarity of nests limits the availability of training data. These challenges are not unique to wildlife surveys and we show how they can be overcome by an innovative integration of object-based image analyses (OBIA) and the powerful machine learning one-class classifier Maxent. Maxent classifications using features characterizing object texture, geometry and neigh-borhood, along with limited object color information, successfully identified over 90{\%} of high quality nests (most weathered and unusually shaped nests were also detected, but at a slightly lower rate) and labeled {\textless}2{\%} of objects as candidate nests. Although this overestimates the occurrence of nests, the results can be visu-ally screened to rule out all but the most likely nests in a process that is simpler and more efficient than manual photointerpretation of the full image. Our study shows that semi-automated image analyses for wildlife surveys are achievable. Furthermore, the developed strategies have broad relevance to image processing applications that seek to detect rare features differing only subtly from a heteroge-neous background, including remote sensing of archeological remains. We also highlight solutions to maximize the use of imperfect or uncalibrated image data, such as some UAV-based imagery and the growing body of VHR imagery avail-able in Google Earth and other virtual globes.},

@article{Angeloni2011,
	abstract = {Inbreeding is common in plants and can have considerable effects on population viability, because of inbreeding depression. Understanding what determines the magnitude of inbreeding depression is of fundamental importance for conservation biology. We used meta-analysis of 116 studies and 107 plant species to investigate the effects of population size, test environment, life history characteristics and stage on the magnitude of inbreeding depression in 13 different fitness traits. We found that inbreeding depression levels significantly increase with population size. This may be a consequence of either, or both, a higher baseline of the level of inbreeding or increased impact of purging in small populations; unfortunately the available data did not allow distinguishing between these potential explanations. In general, inbreeding depression was found to be common across species and environments, and was significant in all traits examined. Yet, the magnitude of inbreeding depression was significantly influenced by plant longevity and life-history stage, and varied depending on how plant fitness was measured. Our findings highlight the fundamental role of population size in influencing the magnitude of inbreeding depression in plants. This clearly has important implications for conservation biology. Moreover, our findings on the overall generality of inbreeding depression confirm that inbreeding depression is one of the key factors reducing plant population fitness and viability. Hence, we need a better understanding on the architecture of inbreeding depression, how different ecological and historical conditions influence the levels of inbreeding depression in natural plant populations, and its impacts on community dynamics. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Anisimova2001,
	abstract = {The selective pressure at the protein level is usually measured by the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio ($\omega$ = dN/dS), with $\omega$ {\textless} 1, $\omega$ = 1, and $\omega$ {\textgreater} 1 indicating purifying (or negative) selection, neutral evolution, and diversifying (or positive) selection, respectively. The $\omega$ ratio is commonly calculated as an average over sites. As every functional protein has some amino acid sites under selective constraints, averaging rates across sites leads to low power to detect positive selection. Recently developed models of codon substitution allow the $\omega$ ratio to vary among sites and appear to be powerful in detecting positive selection in empirical data analysis. In this study, we used computer simulation to investigate the accuracy and power of the likelihood ratio test (LRT) in detecting positive selection at amino acid sites. The test compares two nested models: one that allows for sites under positive selection (with $\omega$ {\textgreater} 1), and another that does not, with the X2 distribution used for significance testing. We found that use of the X2 distribution makes the test conservative, especially when the data contain very short and highly similar sequences. Nevertheless, the LRT is powerful. Although the power can be low with only 5 or 6 sequences in the data, it was nearly 100{\%} in data sets of 17 sequences. Sequence length, sequence divergence, and the strength of positive selection also were found to affect the power of the LRT. The exact distribution assumed for the $\omega$ ratio over sites was found not to affect the effectiveness of the LRT.},

@article{Aparicio2006,
	abstract = {The interest to study the effects of inbreeding in natural populations has increased in the last years. Several microsatellite-derived metrics have recently been developed to infer inbreeding from multilocus heterozygosity data without requiring detailed pedigrees that are difficult to obtain in open populations. Internal relatedness (IR) is currently the most widespread used index and its main attribute is that allele frequency is incorporated into the measure. However, IR underestimates heterozygosity of individuals carrying rare alleles. For example, descendants of immigrants paired with natives (normally more outbred) bearing novel or rare alleles would be considered more homozygous than descendants of native parents. Thus, the analogy between homozygosity and inbreeding that generally is carried out would have no logic in those cases. We propose an alternative index, homozygosity by loci (HL) that avoids such problems by weighing the contribution of each locus to the homozygosity index depending on their allelic variability. Under a wide range of simulated scenarios, we found that our index (HL) correlated better than both IR and uncorrected homozygosity (H(O)), measured as proportion of homozygous loci) with genome-wide homozygosity and inbreeding coefficients in open populations. In these populations, which are likely to prevail in nature, the use of HL instead of IR reduced considerably the sample sizes required to achieve a given statistical power. This is likely to have important consequences on the ability to detect heterozygosity fitness correlations assuming the relationship between genome-wide heterozygosity and fitness traits.},

	abstract = {The Endangered Allen Cays Rock Iguana ( Cyclura cychlura inornata ) is endemic to the Allen Cays, a tiny cluster of islands in the Bahamas. Naturally occurring populations exist on only two cays ({\textless}4 ha each). However, populations of unknown origin were recently discovered on four additional cays. To investigate patterns of genetic variation among these populations, we analyzed nuclear and mitochondrial markers for 268 individuals. Analysis of three mitochondrial gene regions (2,328 bp) and data for eight nuclear microsatellite loci indicated low genetic diversity overall. Estimates of effective population sizes based on multilocus genotypes were also extremely low. Despite low diversity, significant population structuring and variation in genetic diversity measures were detected among cays. Genetic data confirm the source population for an experimentally translocated population while raising concerns regarding other, unauthorized, translocations. Reduced heterozygosity is consistent with a documented historical population decline due to overharvest. This study provides the first range-wide genetic analysis of this subspecies. We suggest strategies to maximize genetic diversity during ongoing recovery including additional translocations to establish assurance populations and additional protective measures for the two remaining natural populations.},

	abstract = {We conducted a field study to analyse the social relationships between males of the Iberian rock lizard (Lacerta monticola). The degree of familiarity was determined based on the degree of overlap between their home ranges. We then designed a laboratory experiment to test whether the same males were able to discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics using faecal pellet odours. Differential tongue-flick rates suggest that large males, at least, may discriminate between odours of familiar and unfamiliar males. The behavioural responses were dependent on relative differences in body size between the responding male and the male that donated the faecal pellet. Thus, as responding small males increased in size relative to their corresponding familiar male, their rate of tongue-flicking significantly decreased; this was not the case in response to unfamiliar males. In contrast, there were no significant correlations between the response of large males to familiar or unfamiliar male stimuli, regardless of size differences. These results suggest that chemical cues contained in faecal pellets allow individual recognition in male L. monticola, and that the response depends on body size. We suggest that faecal pellets might be used to scent-mark home ranges, which would contribute to lowering the costs of aggressive interactions.},

	abstract = {The effects of sexual selection on population mean fitness are unclear and a subject of debate. Recent models propose that, because reproductive success may be condition dependent, much of the genome may be a target of sexual selection. Under this scenario, mutations that reduce health, and thus nonsexual fitness, may also be deleterious with respect to reproductive success, meaning that sexual selection may contribute to the purging of deleterious alleles. We tested this hypothesis directly by subjecting replicate Drosophila melanogaster populations to two treatments that altered the opportunity for sexual selection and then tracked changes in the frequency of six separate deleterious alleles with recessive and visible phenotypic effects. While natural selection acted to decrease the frequency of all six mutations, the addition of sexual selection did not aid in the purging of any of them, and for three of them appears to have hampered it. Courtship and mating have harmful effects in this species and mate choice assays showed that males directed more courtship and mating behavior toward wild-type over mutant females, providing a likely explanation for sexual selection's cost. Whether this cost extends to other mutations (e.g., those lacking visible phenotypic effects) is an important topic for future research.},

	abstract = {A 2,479-base pair mitochondrial DNA fragment was sequenced for eight chromosome races of Sceloporus grammicus from central Mexico to estimate their phylogenetic relationships. The species S. poinsetti and S. olivaceus were used separately as alternative outgroups. A total of 795 positions varied in three complete protein-coding genes examined (ND3, ND4L, ND4), and 52 of 292 positions varied across five transfer RNAs examined (glycine, argenine, histidine, serine, leucine). Sequence divergence values ranged from 0.0 to 0.23 among the ingroup taxa, and a maximum of 0.26 was observed between ingroup and outgroup taxa. Alternative analyses based upon equally weighted characters and several alternative character-weighting options were used to obtain phylogenetic hypotheses for the complex, and a single most-parsimonious tree was selected from among these on the basis of a new character-weighting method that takes into account the observed frequencies of all 12 possible substitutions for protein genes. The most-parsimonious cladogram showed that chromosomal evolution in this complex has been more complicated than previously hypothesized. Several rearrangements (Robertsonian fissions) have evolved independently on two or more occasions, which corroborates evidence from other studies showing that single rearrangements are not underdominant upon their origin, and their fixation probabilities are enhanced by repeated origins. These observations refute expectations of some general models of chromosome evolution. The same phylogenetic hypothesis was used to test the minimum-interaction model of chromosome evolution and a specific model for the evolution of macrochromosome 2. A clear distinction was also possible among alternative hypotheses of relationship for three chromosome races involved in hybridization, and the consequences for the role of chromosomal rearrangements in reducing gene flow are discussed in this context.},

	abstract = {Understanding the consequences of inbreeding has important implications for a wide variety of topics in population biology. Although it is often stated in the literature that the deleterious effects of inbreeding (inbreeding depression) are expected to be more pronounced under stressful than benign conditions, this issue remains unresolved and controversial. We review the current literature on the relationship between the magnitude of inbreeding depression and environmental stress and calculate haploid lethal equivalents expressed under relatively benign and stressful conditions based on data from 34 studies. Inbreeding depression increases under stress in 76{\%} of cases, although this increase is only significant in 48{\%} of the studies considered. Estimates of lethal equivalents are significantly greater under stressful (mean = 1.45, median = 1.02) than relatively benign (mean = 0.85, median = 0.61) conditions. This amounts to an approximately 69{\%} increase in inbreeding depression in a stressful vs a benign environment. However, we find strong lineage effects to be ubiquitous among studies that examine inbreeding depression in multiple environments, and a prevalence of conditionally expressed deleterious effects within lineages that are uncorrelated across environments. These results have important implications for both evolutionary and conservation biology.},

	abstract = {While much attention has been paid to the effects of inbreeding on fitness, this has mostly come from a genetic perspective. Consequently, the interaction between inbreeding and the environment is less well understood. To understand the effects of inbreeding in natural populations where environmental conditions are variable, we need to examine not only how the effects of inbreeding change among environments but also how inbreeding may affect the ability to respond to environmental conditions (i.e. phenotypic plasticity). We reared selfed and outcrossed hermaphroditic snails (Physa acuta) in the presence and absence of chemical cues from predatory crayfish and quantified expression of an inducible defence, an adaptively plastic response to predation risk. Overall, inbred snails exhibited reduced defences, but more importantly, inbreeding reduced the expression of predator-induced adaptive plasticity. Inbreeding depression in defensive morphology was 26 per cent and inbreeding depression in the plasticity of this trait was 48 per cent. Inbreeding depression in adaptive plasticity may be important to understanding the effects of inbreeding in nature.},

	abstract = {Of the 10,272 currently recognized reptile species, the trade of fewer than 8{\%} are regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the European Wildlife Trade Regulations (EWTR). However, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List has assessed 45{\%} of the world's reptile species and determined that at least 1390 species are threatened by ``biological resource use''. Of these, 355 species are intentionally targeted by collectors, including 194 non-CITES-listed species. Herein we review the global reptile pet trade, its impacts, and its contribution to the over-harvesting of species and populations, in light of current international law. Findings are based on an examination of relevant professional observations, online sources, and literature (e.g., applicable policies, taxonomy [reptile database], trade statistics [EUROSTAT], and conservation status [IUCN Red List]). Case studies are presented from the following countries and regions: Australia, Central America, China, Galapagos Islands (Ecuador), Germany, Europe, India, Indonesia (Kalimantan), Islamic Republic of Iran, Japan, Madagascar, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Western Africa, and Western Asia. The European Union (EU) plays a major role in reptile trade. Between 2004 and 2014 (the period under study), the EU member states officially reported the import of 20,788,747 live reptiles. This review suggests that illegal trade activities involve species regulated under CITES, as well as species that are not CITES-regulated but nationally protected in their country of origin and often openly offered for sale in the EU. Further, these case studies demonstrate that regulations and enforcement in several countries are inadequate to prevent the overexploitation of species and to halt illegal trade activities.},

	abstract = {A distinctive feature of the avian genome is the large heterogeneity in the size of chromosomes, which are usually classified into a small number of macrochromosomes and numerous microchromosomes. These chromosome classes show characteristic differences in a number of interrelated features that could potentially affect the rate of sequence evolution, such as GC content, gene density, and recombination rate. We studied the effects of these factors by analyzing patterns of nucleotide substitution in two sets of chicken-turkey sequence alignments. First, in a set of 67 orthologous introns, divergence was significantly higher in microchromosomes (chromosomes 11-38; 11.7{\%} divergence) than in both macrochromosomes (chromosomes 1-5; 9.9{\%} divergence; P = 0.016) and intermediate-sized chromosomes (chromosomes 6-10; 9.5{\%} divergence; P = 0.026). At least part of this difference was due to the higher incidence of CpG sites on microchromosomes. Second, using 155 orthologous coding sequences we noted a similar pattern, in which synonymous substitution rates on microchromosomes (13.1{\%}) were significantly higher than were rates on macrochromosomes (10.3{\%}; P = 0.024). Broadly assuming neutrality of introns and synonymous sites, or constraints on such sequences do not differ between chromosomal classes, these observations imply that microchromosomal genes are exposed to more germ line mutations than those on other chromosomes. We also find that dN/dS ratios for genes located on microchromosomes (average, 0.094) are significantly lower than those of macrochromosomes (average, 0.185; P = 0.025), suggesting that the proteins of genes on microchromosomes are under greater evolutionary constraint.},

Yet, this index requires taxonomic assignment of specimens, which typically involves a time and resource consuming visual identification of each sample. DNA barcoding or metabarcoding are potential harmonized, faster and cheaper alternatives for species identification, although the suitability of these methods for easing the implementation of the AMBI is yet to be evaluated. Here, we analyze the requirements for the implementation of a genetics based AMBI (gAMBI), and show, using available sequence data, that information about presence/absence of the most frequently occurring species provides accurate AMBI values. Our results set the basics for the implementation of the gAMBI, which has direct implications for a faster and cheaper marine monitoring and health status assessment.},

	abstract = {Effective population size (N(e)) is a key parameter to understand evolutionary processes and the viability of endangered populations as it determines the rate of genetic drift and inbreeding. Low Ne can lead to inbreeding depression and reduced population adaptability. In this study, we estimated contemporary N(e) using genetic estimators (LDNE, ONeSAMP, MLNE and CoNe) as well as a demographic estimator in a natural insular house sparrow metapopulation. We investigated whether population characteristics (population size, sex ratio, immigration rate, variance in population size and population growth rate) explained variation within and among populations in the ratio of effective to census population size (N(e)/N(c)). In general, N(e)/N(c) ratios increased with immigration rates. Genetic N(e) was much larger than demographic N(e), probably due to a greater effect of immigration on genetic than demographic processes in local populations. Moreover, although estimates of genetic N(e) seemed to track N(c) quite well, the genetic N(e) -estimates were often larger than Nc within populations. Estimates of genetic N(e) for the metapopulation were however within the expected range ({\textless}N(c)). Our results suggest that in fragmented populations, even low levels of gene flow may have important consequences for the interpretation of genetic estimates of N(e). Consequently, further studies are needed to understand how N(e) estimated in local populations or the total metapopulation relates to actual rates of genetic drift and inbreeding.Copyright 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

@article{Baeckens2017,
	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. Lizards communicate with others via chemical signals, the composition of which may vary among species. Although the selective pressures and constraints affecting chemical signal diversity at the species level remain poorly understood, the possible role of diet has been largely neglected. The chemical signals of many lizards originate from the femoral glands that exude a mixture of semiochemicals, and may be used in a variety of contexts. We analyzed the lipophilic fraction of the glandular secretions of 45 species of lacertid lizard species by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The proportions of nine major chemical classes (alcohols, aldehydes, fatty acids, furanones, ketones, steroids, terpenoids, tocopherols and waxy esters), the relative contributions of these different classes (`chemical diversity'), and the total number of different lipophilic compounds (`chemical richness') varied greatly among species. We examined whether interspecific differences in these chemical variables could be coupled to interspecific variation in diet using data from the literature. In addition, we compared chemical signal composition among species that almost never, occasionally, or often eat plant material. We found little support for the hypothesis that the chemical profile of a given species' secretion depends on the type of food consumed. Diet breadth did not correlate with chemical diversity or richness. The amount of plants or ants consumed did not affect the relative contribution of any of the nine major chemical classes to the secretion. Chemical diversity did not differ among lizards with different levels of plant consumption; however, chemical richness was low in species with an exclusive arthropod diet, suggesting that incorporating plants in the diet enables lizards to increase the number of compounds allocated to secretions, likely because a (partly) herbivorous diet allows them to include compounds of plant origin that are unavailable in animal prey. Still, overall, diet appears a relatively poor predictor of interspecific differences in the broad chemical profiles of secretions of lacertid lizards.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Foraging mode plays a pivotal role in traditional reconstructions of squamate evolution. Transitions between modes are said to spark concerted changes in the morphology, physiology, behaviour, and life history of lizards. With respect to their sensory systems, species that adopt a sit-and-wait strategy are thought to rely on visual cues primarily, while actively hunting species would predominantly use chemical information. The morphology of the tongue and the vomeronasal-organs is believed to mirror this dichotomy. Still, support for this idea of concerted evolution of the morphology of the lizard sensory system merely originates from studies comparing only a few, distantly related taxa that differ in many aspects of their biology besides foraging mode. Hence, we compared vomeronasal-lingual morphology among closely related lizard species (Lacertidae). Our findings show considerable interspecific variation indicating that the chemosensory system of lacertids has undergone substantial change over a short evolutionary time. Although our results imply independent evolution of tongue and vomeronasal-organ form, we find evidence for co-variation between sampler and sensor, hinting towards an 'optimization' for efficient chemoreception. Furthermore, our findings suggest species' degree of investment in chemical signalling, and not foraging behaviour, as a leading factor driving the diversity in vomeronasal-lingual morphology among lacertid species.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors. Functional Ecology {\textcopyright} 2017 British Ecological Society The signals that animals use to communicate often differ considerably among species. Part of this variation in signal design may derive from differential natural selection on signal efficacy; the ability of the signal to travel efficiently through the environment and attract the receiver's attention. For the visual and acoustic modalities, the effect of the physical environment on signal efficacy is a well-studied selective force. Still, very little is known on its impact on chemical signals. Here, we took a broad, phylogenetic comparative approach to test for a relationship between animals' signal chemistry and properties of their natural environment. Our study focused on lizards from the Lacertidae family. We sampled 64 species across three continents and determined the lipophilic composition of their glandular signalling secretions using gas chromatography--mass spectrometry. For each species, an array of environmental variables of high temporal and spatial resolution was obtained from climate databases. Species varied considerably in the overall richness (number of constituents) of their secretions, as well as in the relative contribution of the major chemical compound classes. Signal richness and the relative contribution of the respective compounds exhibited little evidence of phylogenetic relatedness, suggesting that chemical signals may change very rapidly. Neither insularity nor substrate use affected chemical signal composition, however, we found a strong statistical relationship between the chemistry of the lizards' secretions and aspects of the thermal and hydric environment they inhabit. Species from `xeric' milieus contained high proportions of stable fatty acid esters and high molecular weight alcohols in their glandular secretions, which likely increase the persistence of secretion scent-marks. In contrast, species inhabiting `mesic' environments produced secretions of a high chemical richness comprising high levels of aldehydes and low molecular weight alcohols. This chemical mix probably creates a volatile-rich signal that can be used for long-distance airborne communication. We argue that the observed variation in signal design results from differential natural selection, optimizing signal efficacy under contrasting environmental conditions.

	abstract = {Animal signals can differ considerably in complexity and composition, even among closely related species. Work on vocal and visual signals has revealed how sexual selection can elaborate signals relevant in mate choice or rival assessment, but few studies have investigated this process in chemical signals. In this study, we correlated chemical signalling diversity and richness with degree of sexual dimorphism in a data set of 60 species of the lizard family Lacertidae. The femoral glands of male lacertid lizards exude waxy secretions, of which the lipophilic fraction is known to function in chemical communication. We determined the composition of the gland secretions using gas chromatography mass spectrometry and calculated the chemical richness (total number of compounds) and the chemical diversity (Shannon-Wiener H') for each species. We used sexual dimorphism in size, in shape, and a combination of both, as proxies for the intensity of sexual selection acting on each species. Although our data revealed considerable interspecific variation in the composition and complexity of the chemical signals, as well as in sexual dimorphism, we found no evidence for the idea that more elaborate signals arise through intensified sexual selection. We offer a number of conceptual and methodological explanations for this unexpected finding.

@article{Bagchi2014,
	abstract = {Tropical forests are important reservoirs of biodiversity, but the processes that maintain this diversity remain poorly understood. The Janzen-Connell hypothesis suggests that specialized natural enemies such as insect herbivores and fungal pathogens maintain high diversity by elevating mortality when plant species occur at high density (negative density dependence; NDD). NDD has been detected widely in tropical forests, but the prediction that NDD caused by insects and pathogens has a community-wide role in maintaining tropical plant diversity remains untested. We show experimentally that changes in plant diversity and species composition are caused by fungal pathogens and insect herbivores. Effective plant species richness increased across the seed-to-seedling transition, corresponding to large changes in species composition. Treating seeds and young seedlings with fungicides significantly reduced the diversity of the seedling assemblage, consistent with the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. Although suppressing insect herbivores using insecticides did not alter species diversity, it greatly increased seedling recruitment and caused a marked shift in seedling species composition. Overall, seedling recruitment was significantly reduced at high conspecific seed densities and this NDD was greatest for the species that were most abundant as seeds. Suppressing fungi reduced the negative effects of density on recruitment, confirming that the diversity-enhancing effect of fungi is mediated by NDD. Our study provides an overall test of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis and demonstrates the crucial role that insects and pathogens have both in structuring tropical plant communities and in maintaining their remarkable diversity.},

@article{Ballard2004,
	abstract = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been used to study molecular ecology and phylogeography for 25 years. Much important information has been gained in this way, but it is time to reflect on the biology of the mitochondrion itself and consider opportunities for evolutionary studies of the organelle itself and its ecology, biochemistry and physiology. This review has four sections. First, we review aspects of the natural history of mitochondria and their DNA to show that it is a unique molecule with specific characteristics that differ from nuclear DNA. We do not attempt to cover the plethora of differences between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA; rather we spotlight differences that can cause significant bias when inferring demographic properties of populations and/or the evolutionary history of species. We focus on recombination, effective population size and mutation rate. Second, we explore some of the difficulties in interpreting phylogeographical data from mtDNA data alone and suggest a broader use of multiple nuclear markers. We argue that mtDNA is not a sufficient marker for phylogeographical studies if the focus of the investigation is the species and not the organelle. We focus on the potential bias caused by introgression. Third, we show that it is not safe to assume a priori that mtDNA evolves as a strictly neutral marker because both direct and indirect selection influence mitochondria. We outline some of the statistical tests of neutrality that can, and should, be applied to mtDNA sequence data prior to making any global statements concerning the history of the organism. We conclude with a critical examination of the neglected biology of mitochondria and point out several surprising gaps in the state of our knowledge about this important organelle. Here we limelight mitochondrial ecology, sexually antagonistic selection, life-history evolution including ageing and disease, and the evolution of mitochondrial inheritance.},

@article{Balloux2004,
	abstract = {Many recent studies report that individual heterozygosity at a handful of apparently neutral microsatellite markers is correlated with key components of fitness, with most studies invoking inbreeding depression as the likely underlying mechanism. The implicit assumption is that an individual's inbreeding coefficient can be estimated reliably using only 10 or so markers, but the validity of this assumption is unclear. Consequently, we have used individual-based simulations to examine the conditions under which heterozygosity and inbreeding are likely to be correlated. Our results indicate that the parameter space in which this occurs is surprisingly narrow, requiring that inbreeding events are both frequent and severe, for example, through selfing, strong population structure and/or high levels of polygyny. Even then, the correlations are strong only when large numbers of loci ({\~{}}200) can be deployed to estimate heterozygosity. With the handful of markers used in most studies, correlations only become likely under the most extreme scenario we looked at, namely 20 demes of 20 individuals coupled with strong polygyny. This finding is supported by the observation that heterozygosity is only weakly correlated among markers within an individual, even in a dataset comprising 400 markers typed in diverse human populations, some of which favour consanguineous marriages. If heterozygosity and inbreeding coefficient are generally uncorrelated, then heterozygosity-fitness correlations probably have little to do with inbreeding depression. Instead, one would need to invoke chance linkage between the markers used and one or more gene(s) experiencing balancing selection. Unfortunately, both explanations sit somewhat uncomfortably with current understanding. If inbreeding is the dominant mechanism, then our simulations indicate that consanguineous mating would have to be vastly more common than is predicted for most realistic populations. Conversely, if heterosis provides the answer, there need to be many more polymorphisms with major fitness effects and higher levels of linkage disequilibrium than are generally assumed.},

@article{Bandelt1999a,
	abstract = {Reconstructing phylogenies from intraspecific data (such as human mitochondrial DNA variation) is often a challenging task because of large sample sizes and small genetic distances between individuals. The resulting multitude of plausible trees is best expressed by a network which displays alternative potential evolutionary paths in the form of cycles. We present a method ("median joining" [MJ]) for constructing networks from recombination-free population data that combines features of Kruskal's algorithm for finding minimum spanning trees by favoring short connections, and Farris's maximum-parsimony (MP) heuristic algorithm, which sequentially adds new vertices called "median vectors", except that our MJ method does not resolve ties. The MJ method is hence closely related to the earlier approach of Foulds, Hendy, and Penny for estimating MP trees but can be adjusted to the level of homoplasy by setting a parameter epsilon. Unlike our earlier reduced median (RM) network method, MJ is applicable to multistate characters (e.g., amino acid sequences). An additional feature is the speed of the implemented algorithm: a sample of 800 worldwide mtDNA hypervariable segment I sequences requires less than 3 h on a Pentium 120 PC. The MJ method is demonstrated on a Tibetan mitochondrial DNA RFLP data set.},

	abstract = {Analysis of variation in the hypervariable region of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has emerged as an important tool for studying human evolution and migration. However, attempts to reconstruct optimal intraspecific mtDNA phylogenies frequently fail because parallel mutation events partly obscure the true evolutionary pathways. This makes it inadvisable to present a single phylogenetic tree at the expense of neglecting equally acceptable ones. As an alternative, we propose a novel network approach for portraying mtDNA relationships. For small sample sizes ({\textless} approximately 50), an unmodified median network contains all most parsimonious trees, displays graphically the full information content of the sequence data, and can easily be generated by hand. For larger sample sizes, we reduce the complexity of the network by identifying parallelisms. This reduction procedure is guided by a compatibility argument and an additional source of phylogenetic information: the frequencies of the mitochondrial haplotypes. As a spin-off, our approach can also assist in identifying sequencing errors, which manifest themselves in implausible network substructures. We illustrate the advantages of our approach with several examples from existing data sets.},

	abstract = {We consider specific additive decompositions d = d1 + ... + dn of metrics, defined on a finite set X (where a metric may give distance zero to pairs of distinct points). The simplest building stones are the slit metrics, associated to splits (i.e., bipartitions) of the given set X. While an additive decomposition of a Hamming metric into split metrics is in no way unique, we achieve uniqueness by restricting ourselves to coherent decompositions, that is, decompositions d = d1 + ... + dn such that for every map f:X → R with f(x) + f(y) ≥ d(x, y) for all x, y $\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}} X there exist maps f1, ..., fn: X → R with f = f1 + ... + fn and fi(x) + fi(y) ≥ di(x, y) for all i = 1,..., n and all x, y $\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}} X. These coherent decompositions are closely related to a geometric decomposition of the injective hull of the given metric. A metric with a coherent decomposition into a (weighted) sum of split metrics will be called totally split-decomposable. Tree metrics (and more generally, the sum of two tree metrics) are particular instances of totally split-decomposable metrics. Our main result confirms that every metric admits a coherent decomposition into a totally split-decomposable metric and a split-prime residue, where all the split summands and hence the decomposition can be determined in polynomial time, and that a family of splits can occur this way if and only if it does not induce on any four-point subset all three splits with block size two. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

	abstract = {Based on the computation of the influence function, a tool to measure the impact of each piece of sampled data on the statistical inference of a parameter, we propose to analyze the support of the maximum-likelihood (ML) tree for each site. We provide a new tool for filtering data sets (nucleotides, amino acids, and others) in the context of ML phylogenetic reconstructions. Because different sites support different phylogenic topologies in different ways, outlier sites, that is, sites with a very negative influence value, are important: they can drastically change the topology resulting from the statistical inference. Therefore, these outlier sites must be clearly identified and their effects accounted for before drawing biological conclusions from the inferred tree. A matrix containing 158 fungal terminals all belonging to Chytridiomycota, Zygomycota, and Glomeromycota is analyzed. We show that removing the strongest outlier from the analysis strikingly modifies the ML topology, with a loss of as many as 20{\%} of the internal nodes. As a result, estimating the topology on the filtered data set results in a topology with enhanced bootstrap support. From this analysis, the polyphyletic status of the fungal phyla Chytridiomycota and Zygomycota is reinforced, suggesting the necessity of revisiting the systematics of these fungal groups. We show the ability of influence function to produce new evolution hypotheses.},

	abstract = {In many animals, chemical signals play an important role in species recognition and may contribute to reproductive isolation and speciation. The Iberian lizards of the genus Podarcis, with up to nine currently recognized lineages that are often sympatric, are highly chemosensory and provide an excellent model for the study of chemically mediated species recognition in closely related taxa. In this study, we tested the ability of male and female lizards of two sister species with widely overlapping distribution ranges (Podarcis bocagei and P. hispanica type 1) to discriminate between conspecific and heterospecific mates by using only substrate-borne chemical cues. We scored the number of tongue flicks directed at the paper substrate by each individual in a terrarium previously occupied by a conspecific or a heterospecific lizard of the opposite sex. Results show that males of P. bocagei and P. hispanica type 1 are capable of discriminating chemically between conspecifics and heterospecifics of the opposite sex, but females are not. These results suggest that differences in female, but not male, chemical cues may underlie species recognition and contribute to reproductive isolation in these species. The apparent inability of females to discriminate conspecific from heterospecific males, which is not because of reduced baseline exploration rates, is discussed in the context of sexual selection theory and species discrimination.},

Indeed, a consensus about the phylogeny of the hard ticks has emerged which is quite different to the working hypothesis of 10 years ago. So that the classification reflects our knowledge of ticks, several changes to the nomenclature of ticks are imminent or have been made. One subfamily, the Hyalomminae, should be sunk, while another, the Bothriocrotoninae, has been created (Klompen, Dobson {\&} Barker, 2002). Bothriocrotoninae, and its sole genus Bothriocroton, have been created to house an early-diverging ('basal') lineage of endemic Australian ticks that used to be in the genus Aponomma. The remaining species of the genus Aponomma have been moved to the genus Amblyomma. Thus, the name Aponomma is no longer a valid genus name. The genus Rhipicephalus is paraphyletic with respect to the genus Boophilus. Thus, the genus Boophilus has become a subgenus of the genus Rhipicephalus (Murrell {\&} Barker, 2003). Knowledge of the phylogenetic relationships of ticks has also provided new insights into the evolution of ornateness and of their life cycles, and has allowed the historical zoogeography of ticks to be studied. Finally, we present a list of the 899 valid genus and species names of ticks as of February 2004.},

Analysis shows how the inbreeding depression decreases as population size becomes smaller and/or the rate of inbreeding increases. This pattern contrasts with that for the load, which increases as population size becomes smaller but decreases as inbreeding rate goes up. The depression and load both approach asymptotic limits when the population size becomes very large or very small. Numerical results show that the transition between the small and the large population regimes is quite rapid, and occurs largely over a range of population sizes that vary by a factor of 10. The effects of drift on inbreeding depression may bias some estimates of the genomic rate of deleterious mutation. These effects could also be important in the evolution of breeding systems in hermaphroditic organisms and in the conservation of endangered populations.},

	abstract = {The present study aimed firstly, to test for a temperature effect on North Sea haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus growth and secondly, to develop a model that could be used to assess total length (L(T)) and mass (M)-at-age response to different temperature scenarios. The von Bertalanffy growth model was fitted on a cohort-by-cohort basis from 1970 to 2006. The asymptotic L(T) (L(∞)) was negatively correlated with temperature while the rate at which L(∞) is reached (K) was positively correlated with temperature. K was negatively correlated with density, whereas no effect on L(∞) was observed. These effects were incorporated into a von Bertalanffy model which was extended to include temperature and density as explanatory variables. Only the temperature variable was significant. Fitting the extended von Bertalanffy model revealed that L(∞) decreased while K increased with increasing temperature, resulting in up to a 40{\%} loss of individual yield at older ages. The dramatic decline observed in the mean age at which 50{\%} of the population becomes mature suggests that higher temperatures resulted in larger young M. aeglefinus that matured earlier and therefore reached a smaller maximum size. In a global warming context, the loss of individual yield observed at old ages is likely to reduce the fisheries yield for M. aeglefinus in the North Sea.},

	abstract = {Carnivorous Nepenthes pitcher plants capture arthropods with specialized slippery surfaces. The key trapping surface, the pitcher rim (peristome), is highly slippery when wetted by rain, nectar or condensation, but not when dry. As natural selection should favour adaptations that maximize prey intake, the evolution of temporarily inactive traps seems paradoxical. Here, we show that intermittent trap deactivation promotes 'batch captures' of ants. Prey surveys revealed that N. rafflesiana pitchers sporadically capture large numbers of ants from the same species. Continuous experimental wetting of the peristome increased the number of non-recruiting prey, but decreased the number of captured ants and shifted their trapping mode from batch to individual capture events. Ant recruitment was also lower to continuously wetted pitchers. Our experimental data fit a simple model that predicts that intermittent, wetness-based trap activation should allow safe access for 'scout' ants under dry conditions, thereby promoting recruitment and ultimately higher prey numbers. The peristome trapping mechanism may therefore represent an adaptation for capturing ants. The relatively rare batch capture events may particularly benefit larger plants with many pitchers. This explains why young plants of many Nepenthes species additionally employ wetness-independent, waxy trapping surfaces.},

By the incorporation of time and temperature as day-degrees, and of the results of length/dry weight regressions, estimates were made of seasonal changes in weight, and of fecundity as mantle weight loss on spawning. The results agreed well with independent estimates of growth made by integrating the results of physiological measurements of energy balance. Differences between production estimates for individual mussels at the two sites are discussed and related to various physiological differences, chiefly the the seasonal pattern of the efficiency of absorption of energy from the ingested ration. Somatic production is shown to be similarly dependent on temperature in both populations, but seasonally abnormal temperatures and a reduced quality of available food at one site caused a marked reduction in the gametes},

	abstract = {Symbiotic microbes can dramatically impact host health and fitness, and recent research in a diversity of systems suggests that different symbiont community structures may result in distinct outcomes for the host. In amphibians, some symbiotic skin bacteria produce metabolites that inhibit the growth of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a cutaneous fungal pathogen that has caused many amphibian population declines and extinctions. Treatment with beneficial bacteria (probiotics) prevents Bd infection in some amphibian species and creates optimism for conservation of species that are highly susceptible to chytridiomycosis, the disease caused by Bd. In a laboratory experiment, we used Bd-inhibitory bacteria from Bd-tolerant Panamanian amphibians in a probiotic development trial with Panamanian golden frogs, Atelopus zeteki, a species currently surviving only in captive assurance colonies. Approximately 30{\%} of infected golden frogs survived Bd exposure by either clearing infection or maintaining low Bd loads, but this was not associated with probiotic treatment. Survival was instead related to initial composition of the skin bacterial community and metabolites present on the skin. These results suggest a strong link between the structure of these symbiotic microbial communities and amphibian host health in the face of Bd exposure and also suggest a new approach for developing amphibian probiotics. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Tandem repeats have been shown to cause human disease, may play a variety of regulatory and evolutionary roles and are important laboratory and analytic tools. Extensive knowledge about pattern size, copy number, mutational history, etc. for tandem repeats has been limited by the inability to easily detect them in genomic sequence data. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for finding tandem repeats which works without the need to specify either the pattern or pattern size. We model tandem repeats by percent identity and frequency of indels between adjacent pattern copies and use statistically based recognition criteria. We demonstrate the algorithm's speed and its ability to detect tandem repeats that have undergone extensive mutational change by analyzing four sequences: the human frataxin gene, the human beta T cellreceptor locus sequence and two yeast chromosomes. These sequences range in size from 3 kb up to 700 kb. A World Wide Web server interface atc3.biomath.mssm.edu/trf.html has been established for automated use of the program.},

This annotation information, which has accumulated over two decades, has been obtained with a diverse set of computational tools and annotation strategies. Despite all efforts of manual curation it is still plagued by misassignments of reading directions, erroneous gene names, and missing as well as false positive annotations in particular for the RNA genes. Taken together, this causes substantial problems for fully automatic pipelines that aim to use these data comprehensively for studies of animal phylogenetics and the molecular evolution of mitogenomes. The MITOS pipeline is designed to compute a consistent de novo annotation of the mitogenomic sequences. We show that the results of MITOS match RefSeq and MitoZoa in terms of annotation coverage and quality.

	abstract = {It is widely accepted among conservation biologists that genetics is, more than ever, an essential and efficient tool for wild and captive population management and reserve design. However, a true synergy between population genetics and conservation biology is lacking. Following the first International Workshop on Population Genetics for Animal Conservation in 2003 at the Centro di Ecologia Alpina, Trento, Italy (recently incorporated into the Edmund Mach Foundation), the scientific committee felt that, given the global urgency of animal conservation, it was imperative that discussions at the conference were made accessible to graduate students and wildlife managers. This book integrates `the analytical methods approach' with the `real problems approach' in conservation genetics. Each chapter is an exhaustive review of one area of expertise, and a special effort has been made to explain the statistical tools available for the analysis of molecular data as clearly as possible. The result is a comprehensive volume of the state of the art in conservation genetics, illustrating the power and utility of this synergy.},

	abstract = {The R{\'{e}}union grey white-eye, Zosterops borbonicus, a passerine bird endemic to R{\'{e}}union Island in the Mascarene archipelago, represents an extreme case of microgeographical plumage colour variation in birds, with four distinct colour forms occupying different parts of this small island (2512 km(2)). To understand whether such population differentiation may reflect low levels of dispersal and gene flow at a very small spatial scale, we examined population structure and gene flow by analysing variation at 11 microsatellite loci among four geographically close localities ({\textless}26 km apart) sampled within the distribution range of one of the colour forms, the brown-headed brown form. Our results revealed levels of genetic differentiation that are exceptionally high for birds at such a small spatial scale. This strong population structure appears to reflect low levels of historical and contemporary gene flow among populations, unless very close geographically ({\textless}10 km). Thus, we suggest that the R{\'{e}}union grey white-eye shows an extremely reduced propensity to disperse, which is likely to be related to behavioural processes.},

It also consists of additional functions to divide analyses among combinations of populations within a single data set without the need to manually produce multiple projects, as it is currently the case in STRUCTURE. The package consists of two main functions: MPI{\_}structure() and parallel{\_}structure() as well as an example data file.

For example, the first protein structure, haemoglobin provided a molecular explanation for the genetic disease sickle cell anaemia. A single nucleotide mutation leads to a substitution of glutamate in normal individuals with valine in those who suffer the disease. The substitution leads to a lower solubility of the deoxygenated form of haemoglobin and it is thought that this causes the molecules to form long fibres within blood cells which leads to the unusual sickle-shaped cells that give the disease its name.},

@article{Bierne1998,
	abstract = {This paper reports new experimental evidence on the effect of inbreeding on growth and survival in the early developmental phase of a marine bivalve, the flat oyster Ostrea edulis. Two crosses between full sibs were analyzed using four microsatellite markers. Samples of 96 individuals were taken just after spawning (day 1), at the end of the larval stage before metamorphosis (day 10) and at the postlarval stage (day 70). Significant departure from Mendelian expectation was observed at two loci in the first cross and two loci in the second. Departure from 1:1 segregation occurred in one parent of the first cross at three loci and genotypic selection, which resulted in highly significant heterozygote excesses, was recorded at three out of four loci in cross C1 and at two out of three loci in cross C2. Across the four markers, there were similar significant excesses of multilocus heterozygosity, and significant multilocus heterozygosity-growth correlations were recorded for both crosses at all stages. These results suggest that microsatellite markers, often assumed to be neutral, cosegregated with fitness-associated genes, the number of which is estimated to be between 15 and 38 in the whole genome, and that there is a potentially high genetic load in Ostrea edulis genome. This load provides a genetic basis for heterosis in marine bivalves.},

@article{Bijlsma2000,
	abstract = {A fundamental assumption underlying the importance of genetic risks within conservation biology is that inbreeding increases the extinction probability of populations. Although inbreeding has been shown to have a detrimental impact on individual fitness, its contribution to extinction is still poorly understood. We have studied the consequences of different levels of prior inbreeding for the persistence of small populations using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. To this end, we determined the extinction rate of small vial populations differing in the level of inbreeding under both optimal and stress conditions, i.e. high temperature stress and ethanol stress. We show that inbred populations have a significantly higher short-term probability of extinction than non-inbred populations, even for low levels of inbreeding, and that the extinction probability increases with increasing inbreeding levels. In addition, we observed that the effects of inbreeding become greatly enhanced under stressful environmental conditions. More importantly, our results show that the impact of environmental stress becomes significantly greater for higher inbreeding levels, demonstrating explicitly that inbreeding and environmental stress are not independent but can act synergistically. These effects seem long lasting as the impact of prior inbreeding was still qualitatively the same after the inbred populations had been expanded to appreciable numbers and maintained as such for approximately 50 generations. Our observations have significant consequences for conservation biology},

@article{Bittkau2005,
	abstract = {Continental shelf island systems, created by rising sea levels, provide a premier setting for studying the effects of past fragmentation, dispersal, and genetic drift on taxon diversification. We used phylogeographical (nested clade) and population genetic analyses to elucidate the relative roles of these processes in the evolutionary history of the Aegean Nigella arvensis alliance (= 'coenospecies'). We surveyed chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) variation in 455 individuals from 47 populations (nine taxa) of the alliance throughout its core range in the Aegean Archipelago and surrounding mainland areas of Greece and Turkey. The study revealed the presence of three major lineages, with largely nonoverlapping distributions in the Western, Central, and Eastern Aegean. There is evidence supporting the idea that these major lineages evolved in situ from a widespread (pan-Aegean) ancestral stock as a result of multiple fragmentation events, possibly due to the influence of post-Messinian sea flooding, Pleistocene eustatic changes and corresponding climate fluctuations. Over-sea dispersal and founder events appear to have played a rather insignificant role in the group's history. Rather, all analytical approaches identified the alliance as an organism group with poor seed dispersal capabilities and a susceptibility to genetic drift. In particular, we inferred that the observed level of cpDNA differentiation between Kikladian island populations of Nigella degenii largely reflects population history, (viz. Holocene island fragmentation) and genetic drift in the near absence of seed flow since their time of common ancestry. Overall, our cpDNA data for the N. arvensis alliance in general, and N. degenii in particular, indicate that historical events were important in determining the phylogeographical patterns seen, and that genetic drift has historically been relatively more influential on population structure than has cytoplasmic gene flow.},

A phylogeny for tick families, subfamilies, and genera has been described based on morphological characters, life histories, and host associations. To test the existing phylogeny, we sequenced approximately 460 bp from the 3' end of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene (rDNA) in 36 hard- and soft-tick species; a mesostigmatid mite, Dermanyssus gallinae, was used as an outgroup. Phylogenies derived using distance, maximum-parsimony, or maximum-likelihood methods were congruent. The existing phylogeny was largely supported with four exceptions. In hard ticks (Ixodidae), members of Haemaphysalinae were monophyletic with the primitive Amblyomminae and members of Hyalomminae grouped within the Rhipicephalinae. In soft ticks (Argasidae), the derived phylogeny failed to support a monophyletic relationship among members of Ornithodorinae and supported placement of Argasinae as basal to the Ixodidae, suggesting that hard ticks may have originated from an Argas-like ancestor. Because most Argas species are obligate bird octoparasites, this result supports earlier suggestions that hard ticks did not evolve until the late Cretaceous.},

In contrast, the proportions of currently threatened species are independent of the numbers of exotic mammalian predator species, suggesting that the principal threat to island birds has changed through time as species susceptible to exotic predators have been driven extinct.},

Of special concern are populations at the periphery of the species range that might show reduced genetic diversity, thus affecting their adaptive potential at environmental margins. We investigated genetic variability and differentiation of the globally near threatened and locally endangered fire salamander Salamandra infraimmaculata in northern Israel, an area that represents the periphery of this species' distribution range. Analyses of variability in 15 microsatellite loci from 20 sites revealed substantial population structuring, most of which was due to a strong subdivision between two regions separated by a heavily urbanized valley. In addition, levels of genetic variability within populations were lowest in the peripheral, southernmost populations. These results suggest that the conservation plans for this species should recognize the lower diversity and increased divergence in the peripheral regions, and take into account the observed spatial population structure when devising strategies and measures to ensure the species persistence.},

However, few predictors of a population's response to inbreeding are found reliable. The models are most likely to detect inbreeding depression in large populations, that is, in populations in which their statistical power is maximised. Purging was found to be significant in 14 populations and a significant trend of purging was found across populations. The change in inbreeding depression due to purging averaged across the 119 populations is {\textless}1{\%}, however, suggesting that the fitness benefits of purging are rarely appreciable.

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

	abstract = {Animal mitochondrial DNA is a small, extrachromosomal genome, typically {\~{}} 16 kb in size. With few exceptions, all animal mitochondrial genomes contain the same 37 genes: two for rRNAs, 13 for proteins and 22 for tRNAs. The products of these genes, along with RNAs and proteins imported from the cytoplasm, endow mitochondria with their own systems for DNA replication, transcription, mRNA processing and translation of proteins. The study of these genomes as they function in mitochondrial systems - 'mitochondrial genomics' - serves as a model for genome evolution. Furthermore, the comparison of animal mitochondrial gene arrangements has become a very powerful means for inferring ancient evolutionary relationships, since rearrangements appear to be unique, generally rare events that are unlikely to arise independently in separate evolutionary lineages. Complete mitochondrial gene arrangements have been published for 58 chordate species and 29 non-chordate species, and partial arrangements for hundreds of other taxa. This review compares and summarizes these gene arrangements and points out some of the questions that may be addressed by comparing mitochondrial systems.},

	abstract = {Hybridization is an important evolutionary process for many groups of species. Thus, conflicting signals in a data set may not be the result of sampling or modeling errors, but due to the fact that hybridization has played a significant role in the evolutionary history of the species under consideration. Assuming that the initial set of gene trees is correct, a basic problem for biologists is to compute this minimum number of hybridization events to explain this set. In this paper, we describe a new reduction-based algorithm for computing the minimum number, when the initial data set consists of two trees. Although the two-tree problem is NP-hard, our algorithm always gives the exact solution and runs efficiently on many real biological problems. Previous algorithms for the two-tree problem either solve a restricted version of the problem or give an answer with no guarantee of the closeness to the exact solution. We illustrate our algorithm on a grass data set. This new algorithm is freely available for application at either http://www.bi.uni-duesseldorf.de/{\~{}}linz or http://www.math.canterbury.ac.nz/{\~{}}cas83 .},

	abstract = {We present a new open source, extensible and flexible software platform for Bayesian evolutionary analysis called BEAST 2. This software platform is a re-design of the popular BEAST 1 platform to correct structural deficiencies that became evident as the BEAST 1 software evolved. Key among those deficiencies was the lack of post-deployment extensibility. BEAST 2 now has a fully developed package management system that allows third party developers to write additional functionality that can be directly installed to the BEAST 2 analysis platform via a package manager without requiring a new software release of the platform. This package architecture is showcased with a number of recently published new models encompassing birth-death-sampling tree priors, phylodynamics and model averaging for substitution models and site partitioning. A second major improvement is the ability to read/write the entire state of the MCMC chain to/from disk allowing it to be easily shared between multiple instances of the BEAST software. This facilitates checkpointing and better support for multi-processor and high-end computing extensions. Finally, the functionality in new packages can be easily added to the user interface (BEAUti 2) by a simple XML template-based mechanism because BEAST 2 has been re-designed to provide greater integration between the analysis engine and the user interface so that, for example BEAST and BEAUti use exactly the same XML file format.},

	abstract = {Elaboration of Bayesian phylogenetic inference methods has continued at pace in recent years with major new advances in nearly all aspects of the joint modelling of evolutionary data. It is increasingly appreciated that some evolutionary questions can only be adequately answered by combining evidence from multiple independent sources of data, including genome sequences, sampling dates, phenotypic data, radiocarbon dates, fossil occurrences, and biogeographic range information among others. Including all relevant data into a single joint model is very challenging both conceptually and computationally. Advanced computational software packages that allow robust development of compatible (sub-)models which can be composed into a full model hierarchy have played a key role in these developments. Developing such software frameworks is increasingly a major scientific activity in its own right, and comes with specific challenges, from practical software design, development and engineering challenges to statistical and conceptual modelling challenges. BEAST 2 is one such computational software platform, and was first announced over 4 years ago. Here we describe a series of major new developments in the BEAST 2 core platform and model hierarchy that have occurred since the first release of the software, culminating in the recent 2.5 release.},

However, computationally efficient procedures quickly become necessary with large datasets, many evaluation points or more than one covariate. Further computational issues arise in the use of smoothing techniques for inferential, rather than simply descriptive, purposes. These issues are addressed in two ways by (i) deriving efficient matrix formulations of nonparametric smoothing methods and (ii) by describing further simple modifications to these for the use of 'binned' data when sample sizes are large. The implications for other graphical and inferential aspects of the estimators are also discussed. These issues are dealt with in an algorithmic manner, to allow implementation in any programming environment, but particularly those which are geared towards vector and matrix representations of data.

	abstract = {Hispaniola is a geotectonically complex island consisting of two palaeo-islands that docked c. 10 Ma, with a further geological boundary subdividing the southern palaeo-island into eastern and western regions. All three regions have been isolated by marine barriers during the late Cenozoic and possess biogeographically distinct terrestrial biotas. However, there is currently little evidence to indicate whether Hispaniolan mammals show distributional patterns reflecting this geotectonic history, as the island's endemic land mammal fauna is now almost entirely extinct. We obtained samples of Hispaniolan hutia (Plagiodontia aedium), one of the two surviving Hispaniolan land mammal species, through fieldwork and historical museum collections from seven localities distributed across all three of the island's biogeographic regions. Phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome b) reveals a pattern of historical allopatric lineage divergence in this species, with the spatial distribution of three distinct hutia lineages biogeographically consistent with the island's geotectonic history. Coalescent modelling, approximate Bayesian computation and approximate Bayes factor analyses support our phylogenetic inferences, indicating near-complete genetic isolation of these biogeographically separate populations and differing estimates of their effective population sizes. Spatial congruence of hutia lineage divergence is not however matched by temporal congruence with divergences in other Hispaniolan taxa or major events in Hispaniola's geotectonic history; divergence between northern and southern hutia lineages dates to c. 0.6 Ma, significantly later than the unification of the palaeo-islands. The three allopatric Plagiodontia populations should all be treated as distinct management units for conservation, with particular attention required for the northern population (low haplotype diversity) and the south-western population (high haplotype diversity but highly threatened).},

	abstract = {1. Precise estimates of demographic rates are key components of population models used to predict the effects of stochastic environmental processes, harvest scenarios and extinction probability. 2. We used a 12-year photographic identification library of whale sharks from Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia to construct Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model estimates of survival within a capture-mark-recapture (CMR) framework. Estimated survival rates, population structure and assumptions regarding age at maturity, longevity and reproduction frequency were combined in a series of age-classified Leslie matrices to infer the potential trajectory of the population. 3. Using data from 111 individuals, there was evidence for time variation in apparent survival (phi) and recapture probability (p). The null model gave a phi of 0.825 (95{\%} CI: 0.727-0.893) and p = 0.184 (95{\%} CI: 0.121-0.271). The model-averaged annual phi ranged from 0.737 to 0.890. There was little evidence for a sex effect on survival. 4. Using standardized total length as a covariate in the CMR models indicated a size bias in phi. Ignoring the effects of time, a 5-m shark has a phi = 0.59 and a 9 m shark has phi = 0.81. 5. Of the 16 model combinations considered, 10 (63{\%}) indicated a decreasing population (lambda {\textless} 1). For models based on age at first reproduction (alpha) of 13 years, the mean age of reproducing females at the stable age distribution (A) ranged from 15 to 23 years, which increased to 29-37 years when alpha was assumed to be 25. 6. All model scenarios had higher total elasticities for non-reproductive female survival [E(s(nr))] compared to those for reproductive female survival [E(s(r))]. 7. Assuming relatively slow, but biologically realistic, vital rates (alpha = 25 and biennial reproduction) and size-biased survival probabilities, our results suggest that the Ningaloo Reef population of whale sharks is declining, although more reproductive data are clearly needed to confirm this conclusion. Combining relatively precise survival estimates from CMR studies with realistic assumptions of other vital rates provides a useful heuristic framework for determining the vulnerability of large oceanic predators for which few direct data exist.},

	abstract = {1. Geographical variability in, and temperature effects on, the mean date of adult flight period and the SD about this date are analysed for two univoltine, grassland butterflies in England and Wales from 1976 to 1985. Data were collected on the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme for Maniola jurtina (L.) at twenty-nine sites and Pyronia tithonus (L.) at twenty sites. 2. Substantial variability for mean date and SD occurs between years and between sites. Changes in mean date between years tend to occur consistently at different sites. The species show some parallel in variation between sites, especially for mean date. 3. June maximum temperature accounts for 95{\%} and 75{\%} of the variation in mean date between years in M. jurtina and P. tithonus, respectively (r=-0.97 and -0.87). Similar relationships occur for temperatures cumulated over the period of post-winter development from March to July or August. 4. Greater geographical variability in phenology, and a generally less synchronized flight period in M.jurtina may be associated with broader habitat preferences than in P. tithonus. 5. The mean date of adult flight period remains at roughly the same date at more northerly latitudes. In M.jurtina the flight period becomes more synchronized, begins later and ends earlier in the north. P. tithonus shows little or no indication of such a response to latitude. This is discussed with regard to changes in season length and factors limiting the species'range.},

	abstract = {(1) The behaviour, microdistribution and dispersal of the meadow brown butterfly Maniolajurtina was investigated using mark-release-recapture techniques. (2) The main study site was a meadow at Hightown near Liverpool where a grid of 7-5 m squares was established. (3) Butterflies showed an aggregated microdistribution at Hightown. Intraseasonal changes and differences between years (generations) in microdistribution were correlated with changes in the distribution of clumps of flowering plants. Such changes in males were probably also influenced by the distribution of emerging females. The sexes showed statistically different microdistributions associated with differences in resource require- ments. (4) A low rate of movement from areas of favourable habitat was detected (38 out of 1568 recaptures). The frequency distribution of the distance moved by M. jurtina at Hightown was leptokurtic. Butterflies tended to restrict their activity to familiar areas within the habitat of this population. The home range (95{\%}) of individuals was estimated as 0-85 + 0-065 ha. Inspection of the data indicated that this is an underestimate. Preliminary evidence for individual variation in dispersal behaviour is examined. (5) Males and females showed similar dispersal rates. However, males fly more often than females. Males show a characteristic exploratory flight for mates. Females fly to lay eggs and to feed. Nectar is probably a more important resource for females than males. (6) The present study confirms the hypothesis of Handford (1973) that male and female M. jurtina occupy different ecological niches.},

@article{Brent2015,
	abstract = {Summary Classic life-history theory predicts that menopause should not occur because there should be no selection for survival after the cessation of reproduction [ 1 ]. Yet, human females routinely live 30 years after they have stopped reproducing [ 2 ]. Only two other species---killer whales ( Orcinus orca ) and short-finned pilot whales ( Globicephala macrorhynchus ) [ 3, 4 ]---have comparable postreproductive lifespans. In theory, menopause can evolve via inclusive fitness benefits [ 5, 6 ], but the mechanisms by which postreproductive females help their kin remain enigmatic. One hypothesis is that postreproductive females act as repositories of ecological knowledge and thereby buffer kin against environmental hardships [ 7, 8 ]. We provide the first test of this hypothesis using a unique long-term dataset on wild resident killer whales. We show three key results. First, postreproductively aged females lead groups during collective movement in salmon foraging grounds. Second, leadership by postreproductively aged females is especially prominent in difficult years when salmon abundance is low. This finding is critical because salmon abundance drives both mortality and reproductive success in resident killer whales [ 9, 10 ]. Third, females are more likely to lead their sons than they are to lead their daughters, supporting predictions of recent models [ 5 ] of the evolution of menopause based on kinship dynamics. Our results show that postreproductive females may boost the fitness of kin through the transfer of ecological knowledge. The value gained from the wisdom of elders can help explain why female resident killer whales and humans continue to live long after they have stopped reproducing. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	abstract = {Partamona mulata is a stingless bee species endemic to cerrado, a severely threatened phytogeographical domain. Clearing for pasture without proper soil treatment in the cerrado facilitates the proliferation of termite ground nests, which are the nesting sites for P. mulata. The genetic consequences of these changes in the cerrado environment for bee populations are still understudied. In this work, we analyzed the genetic diversity of 48 colonies of P. mulata collected throughout the species' distribution range by sequencing two mitochondrial genes, cytochrome oxidase I and cytochrome B. A very low polymorphism rate was observed when compared to another Partamona species from the Atlantic forest. Exclusive haplotypes were observed in two of the five areas sampled. The sharing of two haplotypes between collection sites separated by a distance greater than the flight range of queens indicates an ancient distribution for these haplotypes. The low haplotype and nucleotide diversity observed here suggests that P. mulata is either a young species or one that has been through population bottlenecks. Locally predominant and exclusive haplotypes (H2 and H4) may have been derived from local remnants through cerrado deforestation and the expansion of a few colonies with abundant nesting sites.},

@article{Brodin2010,
	abstract = {In this review, I will present an overview of the development of the field of scatter hoarding studies. Scatter hoarding is a conspicuous behaviour and it has been observed by humans for a long time. Apart from an exceptional experimental study already published in 1720, it started with observational field studies of scatter hoarding birds in the 1940s. Driven by a general interest in birds, several ornithologists made large-scale studies of hoarding behaviour in species such as nutcrackers and boreal titmice. Scatter hoarding birds seem to remember caching locations accurately, and it was shown in the 1960s that successful retrieval is dependent on a specific part of the brain, the hippocampus. The study of scatter hoarding, spatial memory and the hippocampus has since then developed into a study system for evolutionary studies of spatial memory. In 1978, a game theoretical paper started the era of modern studies by establishing that a recovery advantage is necessary for individual hoarders for the evolution of a hoarding strategy. The same year, a combined theoretical and empirical study on scatter hoarding squirrels investigated how caches should be spaced out in order to minimize cache loss, a phenomenon sometimes called optimal cache density theory. Since then, the scatter hoarding paradigm has branched into a number of different fields: (i) theoretical and empirical studies of the evolution of hoarding, (ii) field studies with modern sampling methods, (iii) studies of the precise nature of the caching memory, (iv) a variety of studies of caching memory and its relationship to the hippocampus. Scatter hoarding has also been the subject of studies of (v) coevolution between scatter hoarding animals and the plants that are dispersed by these.},

	abstract = {If habitat destruction or overexploitation of populations is severe, species loss can occur directly and abruptly. Yet the final descent to extinction is often driven by synergistic processes (amplifying feedbacks) that can be disconnected from the original cause of decline. We review recent observational, experimental and meta-analytic work which together show that owing to interacting and self-reinforcing processes, estimates of extinction risk for most species are more severe than previously recognised. As such, conservation actions which only target single-threat drivers risk being inadequate because of the cascading effects caused by unmanaged synergies. Future work should focus on how climate change will interact with and accelerate ongoing threats to biodiversity, such as habitat degradation, overexploitation and invasive species. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Generally, linkage (gametic phase) disequilibrium tends to increase the variance above the value expected under complete independence. This increase is greatest when disequilibria are such as to maximize the sum of squares of the two-locus gametic frequencies.-When data on several loci per individual are available, the observed variance may be tested for its agreement with that expected under the hypothesis of complete interlocus independence, using the sampling theory of this model. When applied to allozyme data from 26 polymorphic populations of wild barley, this test demonstrated the presence of geographically widespread multilocus organization. On average, the variance was 80{\%} higher than expected under random association. Gametic frequencies for four esterase loci in both of these populations of wild barley and two composite crosses of cultivated barley were analyzed. Most generations of the composites showed less multilocus structure, as measured by the indices of association, than the wild populations.},

	abstract = {Across bacterial species, metal binding proteins can serve functions in pathogenesis in addition to regulating metal homeostasis. We have compared and contrasted the activities of zinc (Zn2+)-binding lipoproteins AdcA and AdcAII in the Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4 background. Exposure to Zn2+-limiting conditions resulted in delayed growth in a strain lacking AdcAII ($\Delta$AdcAII) when compared to wild type bacteria or a mutant lacking AdcA ($\Delta$AdcA). AdcAII failed to interact with the extracellular matrix protein laminin despite homology to laminin-binding proteins of related streptococci. Deletion of AdcA or AdcAII led to significantly increased invasion of A549 human lung epithelial cells and a trend toward increased invasion in vivo. Loss of AdcAII, but not AdcA, was shown to negatively impact early colonization of the nasopharynx. Our findings suggest that expression of AdcAII affects invasiveness of S. pneumoniae in response to available Zn2+ concentrations.},

@article{Brown1982,
	abstract = {We cloned and sequenced a segment of mitochondrial DNA from human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and gibbon. This segment is 896 bp in length, contains the genes for three transfer RNAs and parts of two proteins, and is homologous in all 5 primates. The 5 sequences differ from one another by base substitutions at 283 positions and by a deletion of one base pair. The sequence differences range from 9 to 19{\%} among species, in agreement with estimates from cleavage map comparisons, thus confirming that the rate of mtDNA evolution in primates is 5 to 10 times higher than in nuclear DNA. The most striking new finding to emerge from these comparisons is that transitions greatly outnumber transversions. Ninety-two percent of the differences among the most closely related species (human, chimpanzee, and gorilla) are transitions. For pairs of species with longer divergence times, the observed percentage of transitions falls until, in the case of comparisons between primates and non-primates, it reaches a value of 45. The time dependence is probably due to obliteration of the record of transitions by multiple substitutions at the same nucleotide site. This finding illustrates the importance of choosing closely related species for analysis of the evolutionary process. The remarkable bias toward transitions in mtDNA evolution necessitates the revision of equations that correct for multiple substitutions at the same site. With revised equations, we calculated the incidence of silent and replacement substitutions in the two protein-coding genes. The silent substitution rate is 4 to 6 times higher than the replacement rate, indicating strong functional constraints at replacement sites. Moreover, the silent rate for these two genes is about 10{\%} per million years, a value 10 times higher than the silent rate for the nuclear genes studied so far. In addition, the mean substitution rate in the three mitochondrial tRNA genes is at least 100 times higher than in nuclear tRNA genes. Finally, genealogical analysis of the sequence differences supports the view that the human lineage branched off only slightly before the gorilla and chimpanzee lineages diverged and strengthens the hypothesis that humans are more related to gorillas and chimpanzees than is the orangutan. {\textcopyright} 1982 Springer-Verlag.},

With the exception of band sharing similarity index, available distance measures were developed specifically for diploid organisms and are unsuited for comparisons of polyploids. Here, we present a simple method for calculation of microsatellite genotype distances, which takes into account mutation processes and permits comparison of individuals with different ploidy levels. This method should provide a valuable tool for intraspecific analyses of polyploid organisms, which are widespread among plants and some animal taxa. An illustration is given using data from the planarian flatworm Schmidtea polychroa (Platyhelminthes).},

	abstract = {Cyclura carinata, a Bahamian rock iguana, currently has two recognized subspecies. Cyclura c. carinata is found on numerous islands and cays throughout the Turks and Caicos Islands. The second subspecies, C. c. bartschi, is now only known to exist on Booby Cay, a small island off of Mayaguana Island, Bahamas, which is also within the subspecies historic range. Support for subspecific status is weak. Geographic isolation appears to be the only strong indicator of genetic isolation. Recent conservation attempts made on the species behalf have raised questions regarding the validity of subspecific designations. We used mtDNA sequence data to ask whether there is any genetic variation that distinguishes C c. bartschi from ten sampled populations of C c. carinata. Our findings show that the Booby Cay population is fixed for a common mtDNA haplotype found in Caicos Island populations of C. carinata. In contrast, four different haplotypes were found among populations designated C. c. carinata. We conclude that there is insufficient evidence to support C. c. bartshi as a subspecies and recommend that the Booby Cay population be included in ongoing conservation efforts currently focused on the Turks and Caicos Islands.},

The subarctic species, C. finmarchicus, shows lower population genetic diversity (haplotype diversity, h = 0.368, SD = 0.043; nucleotide diversity, pi = 0.00370, SD = 0.0026) than the temperate/subtropical species, N. minor (h = 0.824, SD = 0.024; pi = 0.00502, SD = 0.0032). Effective population sizes (N(e), estimated from numbers of haplotypes) and effective female population sizes (Nf(e), estimated from nucleotide diversities) for the two species are 10(7) to 10(10) smaller than census female population sizes (Nf) estimated from observed densities and areal distributions. For both C. finmarchicus and N. minor, Nf approximately 10(15), N(e) approximately 10(8), and Nf(e) approximately 10(5). We hypothesize that the cause of both low levels of molecular diversity and small effective population sizes of the two species is the impact of glaciation during the past 20,000 years. C. finmarchicus may have experienced 75{\%} range reduction and latitudinal displacement during the last glacial maximum at 18,000 years BP, giving rise to a genetic bottleneck; this may explain low diversity and an L-shaped distribution of pairwise haplotype differences. In contrast, N. minor may have experienced range reduction of only 30{\%} and less change in latitudinal extent, with less impact of levels of molecular diversity and the shape of the pairwise difference distribution. Although marine zooplankton species are highly abundant, conservation biologists should note that their numbers may vary significantly on climatic to evolutionary time scales, generating low levels of molecular genetic diversity.},

We conducted behavioral assays in three representative species of parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) to determine their reliance on CHC as species-specific sexual signaling cues. Results: We found a surprising degree of either unspecific or insufficient sexual signaling when CHC are singled out as recognition cues.

	abstract = {Altered behaviour is believed to be the first form of defence against parasite infection, through reducing opportunity for infection or deflecting parasites to sub-optimal sites on hosts. To determine whether the suite of behaviours fish exhibit deter or deflect infection, we tested for differences in salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) infection level and attachment location on three groups of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) that were either normal, behaviourally modified via injection of ketamine hydrochloride or sham-injected procedural controls. The frequency of behaviours differed between behaviourally modified and normal hosts, which resulted in 26--31{\%} fewer lice in normal fish. Louse attachment locations were unaffected by behaviour. Jumping and motionless behaviours were more common and the frequency of burst swimming behaviour was reduced in non-manipulated fish, suggesting that these behaviours restrict parasite attachment success. Our results show that the suite of fine-scale behaviours that normal salmon display at the time of parasite encounter are associated with reduced infestation.},

This paper shows that the Australian sleepy lizard, Tiliqua rugosa (Scincoidea), retains long-term pair fidelity for up to 21 years. However, in some cases pairs separate, and abandoned males have significantly higher tick loads in their last year with their previous female partner than did males that retained their partners from 1 year to the next. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that pair bonds are retained because individuals, both with low infection levels, are less likely to become infected if they remain with the same sexual partner. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

	abstract = {It is argued that the bias in synonymous codon usage observed in unicellular organisms is due to a balance between the forces of selection and mutation in a finite population, with greater bias in highly expressed genes reflecting stronger selection for efficiency of translation. A population genetic model is developed taking into account population size and selective differences between synonymous codons. A biochemical model is then developed to predict the magnitude of selective differences between synonymous codons in unicellular organisms in which growth rate (or possibly growth yield) can be equated with fitness. Selection can arise from differences in either the speed or the accuracy of translation. A model for the effect of speed of translation on fitness is considered in detail, a similar model for accuracy more briefly. The model is successful in predicting a difference in the degree of bias at the beginning than in the rest of the gene under some circumstances, as observed in Escherichia coli, but grossly overestimates the amount of bias expected. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed.},

While chloroplast DNA exhibits the highest diversity, phylogeographic inferences from this marker are blurred by homoplasy and extensive pollen flow. In contrast, the only three mitochondrial haplotypes found provide a clear picture of nonoverlapping areas colonized from different refugia, with no single population having a mixed composition (GST = 1). Comparison of the genetic structure inferred from both organelle genomes allows the investigation of differential seed and pollen dispersal, pointing to pollen, but not seed, dispersal across the Strait of Gibraltar (from Morocco into Iberia).

@article{Burger1994,
	abstract = {Haldane (1937) showed that the reduction of equilibrium mean fitness in an infinite population due to recurrent deleterious mutations depends only on the mutation rate but not on the harmfulness of mutants. His analysis, as well as more recent ones (cf. Crow 1970), ignored back mutation. The purpose of the present paper is to extend these results to arbitrary mutation patterns among alleles and to quantitative genetic traits. We derive first-order approximations for the equilibrium mean fitness (and the mutation load) and determine the order of the error term. For a metric trait under mutation-stabilizing-selection balance our result differs qualitatively from that of Crow and Kimura (1964), whose analysis is based on a Gaussian assumption. Our general approach also yields a mathematical proof that the variance under the usual mutation-stabilizing-selection model is, to first order, micro/s (the house-of cards approximation) as micro/s tends to zero. This holds for arbitrary mutant distributions and does not require that the population mean coincide with the optimum. We show how the mutant distribution determines the order of the error term, and thus the accuracy of the house-of-cards approximation. Upper and lower bounds to the equilibrium variance are derived that deviate only to second order as micro/s tends to zero. The multilocus case is treated under the assumption of global linkage equilibrium.},

@article{Burger1999,
	abstract = {Stabilizing selection for an intermediate optimum is generally considered to deplete genetic variation in quantitative traits. However, conflicting results from various types of models have been obtained. While classical analyses assuming a large number of independent additive loci with individually small effects indicated that no genetic variation is preserved under stabilizing selection, several analyses of two-locus models showed the contrary. We perform a complete analysis of a generalization of Wright's two-locus quadratic-optimum model and investigate numerically the ability of quadratic stabilizing selection to maintain genetic variation in additive quantitative traits controlled by up to five loci. A statistical approach is employed by choosing randomly 4000 parameter sets (allelic effects, recombination rates, and strength of selection) for a given number of loci. For each parameter set we iterate the recursion equations that describe the dynamics of gamete frequencies starting from 20 randomly chosen initial conditions until an equilibrium is reached, record the quantities of interest, and calculate their corresponding mean values. As the number of loci increases from two to five, the fraction of the genome expected to be polymorphic declines surprisingly rapidly, and the loci that are polymorphic increasingly are those with small effects on the trait. As a result, the genetic variance expected to be maintained under stabilizing selection decreases very rapidly with increased number of loci. The equilibrium structure expected under stabilizing selection on an additive trait differs markedly from that expected under selection with no constraints on genotypic fitness values. The expected genetic variance, the expected polymorphic fraction of the genome, as well as other quantities of interest, are only weakly dependent on the selection intensity and the level of recombination.},

	abstract = {We sequenced the entire mitochondrial genomes of 3 species of metastriate ticks: Haemaphysalis formosensis, H. parva, and Amblyomma cajennense. We also sequenced two thirds (ca. 9500. bp) of the mitochondrial genomes of H. humerosa and H. hystricis. We used these 5 mitochondrial genome sequences together with the 13 tick mitochondrial genomes we sequenced previously and the 2 tick mitochondrial genomes sequenced by Black and Roehrdanz (1998), as well as the nuclear rRNA genes from 84 ticks and mites, in phylogenetic analyses. Our analyses reveal deep phylogenetic structure within the genus Haemaphysalis, with at least 2 species, H. parva and H. inermis that are highly divergent from the rest of the genus Haemaphysalis. We identify a region of the 18S rRNA gene which correlates with this division of the genus Haemaphysalis as well as a novel insertion in the mitochondrial genome of H. parva. We reject the hypotheses of Hoogstraal and Aeschlimann (1982) and Barker and Murrell (2004) on the relationships among metastriate genera. Instead, our analysis provides further evidence for the division of the Metastriata into 2 major lineages: (i) Amblyomma s.s. plus Rhipicephalinae (i.e. Rhipicephalus, Hyalomma, Rhipicentor, and Dermacentor); and (ii) Haemaphysalis plus Bothriocroton plus Amblyomma sphenodonti. We also provide further evidence for the polyphyly of the genus Amblyomma with respect to A. sphenodonti and A. elaphense. The most likely position of A. elaphense is sister to the rest of the Metastriata; the most likely position of A. sphenodonti is sister to the genus Bothriocroton. These 2 species do not belong in the genus Amblyomma, and we propose that new genera are required for A. sphenodonti and A. elaphense. ?? 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

	abstract = {Our understanding of the phylogenetic relationships among tick lineages has been limited by the lack of resolution provided by the most commonly used phylogenetic markers. Mitochondrial genomes are increasingly used to address controversial phylogenetic relationships. To date, the complete mitochondrial genomes of eleven tick species have been sequenced; however, only three of these species are metastriate ticks, the most speciose lineage of ticks. In this study, we present the nucleotide sequences of the complete mitochondrial genomes of five more species of metastriate ticks: Amblyomma elaphense, Amblyomma fimbriatum, Amblyomma sphenodonti, Bothriocroton concolor and Bothriocroton undatum. We use complete mitochondrial genome sequences to address the phylogenetic placement of two morphologically 'primitive' species - Am. elaphense and Am. sphenodonti - with respect to the genus Amblyomma. Our analysis of these five mitochondrial genomes with the other eleven tick mitochondrial genomes, as well as analysis of nuclear rRNA genes, provides strong evidence that the genus Amblyomma is polyphyletic with the inclusion of Am. sphenodonti and Am. elaphense. A new genus or two new genera may be required to describe Am. sphenodonti and Am. elaphense. It is also possible that these two species are sisters to two established genera, Bothriocroton in the case of Am. sphenodonti, and Haemaphysalis in the case of Am. elaphense. However, other arrangements of these taxa cannot be excluded with the current data. Thus, while Am. sphenodonti and Am. elaphense do not belong in the genus Amblyomma, the phylogenetic placement of these two species cannot be resolved without more data from metastriate ticks, either greater sampling of mitochondrial genomes, or a large data set of nuclear genes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Global positioning system (GPS) telemetry technology allows us to monitor and to map the details of animal movement, securing vast quantities of such data even for highly cryptic organisms. We envision an exciting synergy between animal ecology and GPS-based radiotelemetry, as for other examples of new technologies stimulating rapid conceptual advances, where research opportunities have been paralleled by technical and analytical challenges. Animal positions provide the elemental unit of movement paths and show where individuals interact with the ecosystems around them. We discuss how knowing where animals go can help scientists in their search for a mechanistic understanding of key concepts of animal ecology, including resource use, home range and dispersal, and population dynamics. It is probable that in the not-so-distant future, intense sampling of movements coupled with detailed information on habitat features at a variety of scales will allow us to represent an animal's cognitive map of its environment, and the intimate relationship between behaviour and fitness. An extended use of these data over long periods of time and over large spatial scales can provide robust inferences for complex, multi-factorial phenomena, such as meta-analyses of the effects of climate change on animal behaviour and distribution.},

	abstract = {Recently Kruglyak, Durrett, Schug, and Aquadro showed that microsatellite equilibrium distributions can result from a balance between polymerase slippage and point mutations. Here, we introduce an elaboration of their model that keeps track of all parts of a perfect repeat and a simplification that ignores point mutations. We develop a detailed mathematical theory for these models that exhibits properties of microsatellite distributions, such as positive skewness of allele lengths, that are consistent with data but are inconsistent with the predictions of the stepwise mutation model. We use our theoretical results to analyze the successes and failures of the genetic distances (delta(mu))(2) and D(SW) when used to date four divergences: African vs. non-African human populations, humans vs. chimpanzees, Drosophila melanogaster vs. D. simulans, and sheep vs. cattle. The influence of point mutations explains some of the problems with the last two examples, as does the fact that these genetic distances have large stochastic variance. However, we find that these two features are not enough to explain the problems of dating the human-chimpanzee split. One possible explanation of this phenomenon is that long microsatellites have a mutational bias that favors contractions over expansions.},

	abstract = {Islands are considered to be natural laboratories in which to examine evolution because of the implicit assumption that limited gene flow allows tests of evolutionary processes in isolated replicates. Here we show that this well-accepted idea requires re-examination. Island inundation during hurricanes can have devastating effects on lizard populations in the Bahamas. After severe storms, islands may be recolonized by over-water dispersal of lizards from neighbouring islands. High levels of gene flow may homogenize genes responsible for divergence, and are widely viewed as a constraining force on evolution. Ultimately, the magnitude of gene flow determines the extent to which populations diverge from one another, and whether or not they eventually form new species. We show that patterns of gene flow among island populations of Anolis lizards are best explained by prevailing ocean currents, and that over-water dispersal has evolutionary consequences. Across islands, divergence in fitness-related morphology decreases with increasing gene flow. Results suggest that over-water dispersal after hurricanes constrains adaptive diversification in Anolis lizards, and that it may have an important but previously undocumented role in this classical example of adaptive radiation.},

	abstract = {Microhabitat selection by reptiles can be affected by a complex interplay of abiotic and biotic factors. The Brown Treesnake (Boiga irregularis) is an efficient nocturnal predator that hunts in the tropical forest canopy and on the ground, using visual and chemical cues. To identify the factors influencing Brown Treesnake microhabitat use, we experimentally manipulated an abiotic factor, moonlight level, and a biotic factor, prey presence. We hypothesized that (1) moonlight would affect microhabitat use and (2) the presence of prey would alter microhabitat use in various moonlight levels. Trials were conducted in a large laboratory chamber with artificial trees in simulated new, half, and full moonlight. In each trial, the snake's location in canopy, subcanopy, or open ground was recorded at 60-sec intervals for 100 min. Treesnake microhabitat use was determined in three moonlight levels without prey present and in two moonlight levels with a mouse (adult Mus musculus) or a Mangrove Monitor (juvenile Varanus indicus) present. The treesnakes used open ground areas more as moonlight decreased, and they used the canopy more as moonlight increased. No significant differences existed within a moonlight level between trials with or without prey. Thus, moonlight appeared to supercede prey availability in affecting Brown Treesnake microhabitat use. Additionally, the effect of nocturnal illumination on Brown Treesnake habitat use may also have important conservation implications regarding trapping techniques and deterring the snakes from specific areas.},

	abstract = {We have developed a portable and easily configurable genome annotation pipeline called MAKER. Its purpose is to allow investigators to independently annotate eukaryotic genomes and create genome databases. MAKER identifies repeats, aligns ESTs and proteins to a genome, produces ab initio gene predictions, and automatically synthesizes these data into gene annotations having evidence-based quality indices. MAKER is also easily trainable: Outputs of preliminary runs are used to automatically retrain its gene-prediction algorithm, producing higher-quality gene-models on subsequent runs. MAKER's inputs are minimal, and its outputs can be used to create a GMOD database. Its outputs can also be viewed in the Apollo Genome browser; this feature of MAKER provides an easy means to annotate, view, and edit individual contigs and BACs without the overhead of a database. As proof of principle, we have used MAKER to annotate the genome of the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea and to create a new genome database, SmedGD. We have also compared MAKER's performance to other published annotation pipelines. Our results demonstrate that MAKER provides a simple and effective means to convert a genome sequence into a community-accessible genome database. MAKER should prove especially useful for emerging model organism genome projects for which extensive bioinformatics resources may not be readily available.},

The Bahamian archipelago covers 300,000 km2, of which 136,000 km2 is shallow bank, and 11,400 km2 is subaerial land. The Commonwealth of the Bahamas comprises the majority of an extensive archipelago of carbonate islands and shallow banks in the western North Atlantic Ocean. The southeastern portion of the same archipelago consists of the Turks and Caicos Islands (British West Indies), and the submerged Mouchoir, Silver, and Navidad banks. Climatically, the Bahamas' temperature ranges from subtropical in the north to semiarid in the south. Today, the northern islands are largely covered by pine barrens with palmetto, but there are regions of limited broadleaf coppice. The Bahamas lie within the zone of the northeast trade winds, and that has resulted in the preferential occurrence of islands on the eastern (windward) side of most banks. As a result of the glacioeustatic control of limestone deposition in the Bahamas, the lithostratigraphic units of Bahamian islands are also allostratigraphic units that are usually bounded by terra rossa paleosols.},

	abstract = {Models of host-parasite coevolution assume the presence of genetic variation for host resistance and parasite infectivity, as well as genotype-specific interactions. We used the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna and its bacterial microparasite Pasteuria ramosa to study genetic variation for host susceptibility and parasite infectivity within each of two populations. We sought to answer the following questions: Do host clones differ in their susceptibility to parasite isolates? Do parasite isolates differ in their ability to infect different host clones? Are there host clone-parasite isolate interactions? The analysis revealed considerable variation in both host resistance and parasite infectivity. There were significant host clone-parasite isolate interactions, such that there was no single host clone that was superior to all other clones in the resistance to every parasite isolate. Likewise, there was no parasite isolate that was superior to all other isolates in infectivity to every host clone. This form of host clone-parasite isolate interaction indicates the potential for coevolution based on frequency-dependent selection. Infection success of original host clone-parasite isolate combinations (i.e., those combinations that were isolated together) was significantly higher than infection success of novel host clone-parasite isolate combinations (i.e., those combinations that were created in the laboratory). This finding is consistent with the idea that parasites track specific host genotypes under natural conditions. In addition, correspondence analysis revealed that some host clones, although distinguishable with neutral genetic markers, were susceptible to the same set of parasite isolates and thus probably shared resistance genes.},

However, various biases and errors are associated with the new sequencing techniques that must be handled properly. We here provide evidence for a source of error that has not yet been taken into account.During amplicon pyrosequencing we incorporate tags in both ends of the amplicons, which allows us to check for tag coherence after sequencing. In several studies we have observed that a small proportion of the resulting sequences possess novel tag combinations. Our observations cannot be explained by primer contamination or PCR chimaeras. This indicates that some DNA fragments switch tags during laboratory setup. If not controlled for, this will cause numerous false positives in downstream analyses. In most amplicon pyrosequencing studies of fungal communities, amplicons are typically tagged in one end only. We suggest that amplicons should be tagged in both ends before pyrosequencing to control for tag switching. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.},

As available software packages implementing the global maximum parsimony (MP) approach only give the possibility to merge resulting topologies into less-resolved consensus trees, MP has often been neglected as an alternative approach to purely algorithmic (i.e., methods defined solely on the basis of an algorithm) "network" construction methods. Here, we propose to search tree space using the MP criterion and present a new algorithm for uniting all equally most parsimonious trees into a single (possibly reticulated) graph. Using simulated sequence data, we compare our method with three purely algorithmic and widely used graph construction approaches (minimum-spanning network, statistical parsimony, and median-joining network). We demonstrate that the combination of MP trees into a single graph provides a good estimate of the true genealogy. Moreover, our analyses indicate that, when internal node haplotypes are not sampled, the median-joining and MP methods provide the best estimate of the true genealogy whereas the minimum-spanning algorithm shows very poor performances.},

Here, we study snake biology using the genome sequence of the Burmese python (Python molurus bivittatus), a model of extreme physiological and metabolic adaptation. We compare the python and king cobra genomes along with genomic samples from other snakes and perform transcriptome analysis to gain insights into the extreme phenotypes of the python. We discovered rapid and massive transcriptional responses in multiple organ systems that occur on feeding and coordinate major changes in organ size and function. Intriguingly, the homologs of these genes in humans are associated with metabolism, development, and pathology. We also found that many snake metabolic genes have undergone positive selection, which together with the rapid evolution of mitochondrial proteins, provides evidence for extensive adaptive redesign of snake metabolic pathways. Additional evidence for molecular adaptation and gene family expansions and contractions is associated with major physiological and phenotypic adaptations in snakes; genes involved are related to cell cycle, development, lungs, eyes, heart, intestine, and skeletal structure, including GRB2-associated binding protein 1, SSH, WNT16, and bone morphogenetic protein 7. Finally, changes in repetitive DNA content, guanine-cytosine isochore structure, and nucleotide substitution rates indicate major shifts in the structure and evolution of snake genomes compared with other amniotes. Phenotypic and physiological novelty in snakes seems to be driven by system-wide coordination of protein adaptation, gene expression, and changes in the structure of the genome.},

	abstract = {We measured the length, width, volume, and weight of 871 freshly laid eggs of 28 clutches of Ctenosaura pectinata. The iguanas were obtained from a tropical dry forest area in central Mexico. The relative clutch mass was related positively to the average egg weight but not to average egg volume. Unlike what usually occurs in lizards, where the body length strongly predicts egg production, in C. pectinata clutch size and egg size were not correlated with female weight or snout-vent length. Observed differences revealed variation in the weight-size of the egg within an individual clutch. Therefore, there is not an optimization of the egg in the studied population of Ctenosaura, as usually occurs in small lizards. This variation associated with reproduction takes place in the middle of the dry season, and may be interpreted as an adaptation to facilitate the adjustment of different phenotypes in environments with extreme drought.},

@article{Caughley1994,
	abstract = {1. Conservation biology has two threads: the small-population paradigm which deals with the effect of smallness on the persistence of a population, and the declining-population paradigm which deals with the cause of smallness and its cure. 2. The processes relevant to the small-population paradigm are amenable to theoretical examination because they generalize across species and are subsumed by an inclusive higher category: stochasticity. 3. In contrast, the processes relevant to the declining-population paradigm are essentially humdrum, being not one but many. So far they have defied tight generalization and hence are of scant theoretical interest. 4. The small-population paradigm has not yet contributed significantly to conserving endangered species in the wild because it treats an effect (smallness) as if it were a cause. It provides an answer only to a trivial question: how long will the population persist if nothing unusual happens? Rather, its major contribution has been to captive breeding and to the design of reserve systems. 5. The declining-population paradigm, on the other hand, is that relevant to most problems of conservation. It summons an investigation to discover the cause of the decline and to prescribe its antidote. Hence, at least at our current level of understanding, it evokes only an ecological investigation which, although utilizing the rigour of tight hypotheses and careful experimentation, is essentially a one-off study of little theoretical interest. 6. The principal contribution of the small-population paradigm is the theoretical underpinning that it imparted to conservation biology, even though most of that theory presently bears tenuous relevance to the specific problems of aiding a species in trouble. It would contribute immeasurably more if some of the theoretical momentum so generated were channelled into providing a theory of driven population declines, thereby liberating the declining-population paradigm from the inefficiency of case-by-case ecological investigations and recovery operations. 7. The declining-population paradigm is urgently in need of more theory. The small-population paradigm needs more practice. Each has much to learn from the other. A cautious intermixing of the two might well lead to a reduction in the rate at which species are presently going extinct.},

Genetic and molecular definition of these three immune hallmarks of cancer offers the opportunity to learn how to deploy specific countermeasures to reverse the situation in favor of the immune system and, eventually, the patient. This new information could be channeled to address what seem to be the three major hallmarks for the immune control of cancer progression: effective procedures to activate immune reactivity; characterization of not-disposable oncoantigens; and counteraction of immune suppression.},

	abstract = {The necessity for conservation of the geneticcomponent of biodiversity is now widelyrecognised. A broad genetic base is required tomaintain evolutionary potential and thepopulation erosion occurring in much of theworld's forests threatens the genetic integrityof many tree species. Spanish Cedar (Cedrela odorata L.) has been under severepressure for generations and is now the focusof a study aimed at assessing the levels anddistribution of genetic diversity in remainingpopulations. Ten Costa Rican populations wereanalysed using chloroplast and AFLP markers.The overall level of diversity was as expectedfor an outcrossing, long-lived, woody species(H T = 0.27). However, this concealeda deep divergence within the species, forchloroplast and AFLP (CT = 0.83)markers. Populations were differentiated in twogroups that exhibited contrasting habitatpreferences and two ecotypes, wet and dry, wereidentified. Within the ecotypes, all but onepopulation were fixed for a single chloroplasthaplotype and within populations, total genomicdiversity levels were low (H S= 0.03--0.13). Populations possessing the dryecotype maintained significantly more diversitythan those from wet regions. Within the wetecotype group, pairwise genetic distancebetween populations fitted an isolation bydistance model. The group was stronglysubdivided and showed isolation by distancearound the southern edge of the centralmountain ranges. The genetic divergence of thetwo ecotypes, observed at both organellar andnuclear loci, identifies evolutionarilysignificant units that, taken together withprevious studies of the species, provide arational basis on which to build a conservationpolicy for the species.},

	abstract = {Recent global warming threatens many species and has already caused population- and species-level extinctions. In particular, high risks of extinction are expected for isolated populations of species with low dispersal abilities. These predictions rely on widely used 'climatic envelope' models, while individual responses, the ultimate driver of a species response to climate change, have been most often neglected. Here, we report on some changes in life-history traits of a dispersal-limited reptile species (a poorly studied taxa) living in isolated populations. Using long-term data on common lizards collected in southern France, we show that individual body size dramatically increased in all the four populations studied over the past 18 years. This increase in body size in all age classes appeared related to a concomitant increase in temperature experienced during the first month of life (August). Daily maximum temperature in August increased by 2.2 degrees C and yearling snout-vent-length increased by about 28{\%}. As a result, adult female body size increased markedly, and, as fecundity is strongly dependent on female body size, clutch size and total reproductive output also increased. For one population where capture-recapture data were available, adult survival was positively related to May temperature. All fitness components investigated therefore responded positively to the increase in temperature, such that it might be concluded that the common lizard has been advantaged by the shift in temperature. We contrast these short-term results with the long-term habitat-based prediction that these populations located close to mountain tops on the southern margin of the species range should be unable to cope with the alteration of their habitat. To achieve a better prediction of a species persistence, one will probably need to combine both habitat and individual-based approaches},

	abstract = {The ease of obtaining genotypic data from wild populations has renewed interest in the relationship between individual genetic diversity and fitness-related traits (heterozygosity-fitness correlations, or HFC). Here we present a comprehensive meta-analysis of HFC studies using powerful multivariate techniques which account for nonindependence of data. We compare these findings with those from univariate techniques, and test the influence of a range of factors hypothesized to influence the strength of HFCs. We found small but significantly positive effect sizes for life-history, morphological, and physiological traits; while theory predicts higher mean effect sizes for life-history traits, effect size did not differ consistently with trait type. Newly proposed measures of variation were no more powerful at detecting relationships than multilocus heterozygosity, and populations predicted to have elevated inbreeding variance did not exhibit higher mean effect sizes. Finally, we found evidence for publication bias, with studies reporting weak, nonsignificant effects being under-represented in the literature. In general, our review shows that HFC studies do not generally reveal patterns predicted by population genetic theory, and are of small effect (less than 1{\%} of the variance in phenotypic characters explained). Future studies should use more genetic marker data and utilize sampling designs that shed more light on the biological mechanisms that may modulate the strength of association, for example by contrasting the strength of HFCs in mainland and island populations of the same species, investigating the role of environmental stress, or by considering how selection has shaped the traits under investigation.},

	abstract = {An understanding of the role of factors intrinsic to a species' life history in structuring contemporary genetic variation is a fundamental, but understudied, aspect of evolutionary biology. Here, we assessed the influence of the propensity to outbreak in shaping worldwide genetic variation in Locusta migratoria, a cosmopolitan pest well known for its expression of density-dependent phase polyphenism. We scored 14 microsatellites in nine subspecies from 25 populations distributed over most of the species' range in regions that vary in the historical frequency and extent of their outbreaks. We rejected the hypothesis that L. migratoria consists of two genetically distinct clusters adapted to habitats either rarely (nonoutbreaking) or cyclically (outbreaking) favourable to increases in population density. We also invalidated the current subspecific taxonomic classification based on morphometrics. Bayesian inferences indicated evidence of a homogenizing effect of outbreaks on L. migratoria population structure. Geographical and ecological barriers to gene flow in conjunction with historical events can also explain the observed patterns. By systematically assessing the effects of null alleles using computer simulations, we also provide a template for the analysis of microsatellite data sets characterized by a high prevalence of null alleles.},

	abstract = {Microsatellite null alleles are commonly encountered in population genetics studies, yet little is known about their impact on the estimation of population differentiation. Computer simulations based on the coalescent were used to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of null alleles, their impact on F(ST) and genetic distances, and the efficiency of estimators of null allele frequency. Further, we explored how the existing method for correcting genotype data for null alleles performed in estimating F(ST) and genetic distances, and we compared this method with a new method proposed here (for F(ST) only). Null alleles were likely to be encountered in populations with a large effective size, with an unusually high mutation rate in the flanking regions, and that have diverged from the population from which the cloned allele state was drawn and the primers designed. When populations were significantly differentiated, F(ST) and genetic distances were overestimated in the presence of null alleles. Frequency of null alleles was estimated precisely with the algorithm presented in Dempster et al. (1977). The conventional method for correcting genotype data for null alleles did not provide an accurate estimate of F(ST) and genetic distances. However, the use of the genetic distance of Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards (1967) corrected by the conventional method gave better estimates than those obtained without correction. F(ST) estimation from corrected genotype frequencies performed well when restricted to visible allele sizes. Both the proposed method and the traditional correction method have been implemented in a program that is available free of charge at http://www.montpellier.inra.fr/URLB/. We used 2 published microsatellite data sets based on original and redesigned pairs of primers to empirically confirm our simulation results.},

Deleterious mutations probably play a major role in causing inbreeding depression. Putting together the different kinds of quantitative genetic data, it is difficult to account for the very large effects of inbreeding on fitness in Drosophila and outcrossing plants without a significant contribution from variability maintained by selection. Overdominant effects of alleles on fitness components seem not to be important in most cases. Recessive or partially recessive deleterious effects of alleles, some maintained by mutation pressure and some by balancing selection, thus seem to be the most important source of inbreeding depression.

We review the major questions and controversies that have preoccupied population geneticists during this time (and were often hotly debated at PGG meetings). We show how theoretical and empirical work has combined to generate a highly productive interaction involving successive developments in the ability to characterise variability at the molecular level, to apply mathematical models to the interpretation of the data and to use the results to answer biologically important questions, even in nonmodel organisms. We also describe the changes from a field that was largely dominated by UK and North American biologists to a much more international one (with the PGG meetings having made important contributions to the increased number of population geneticists in several European countries). Although we concentrate on the earlier history of the field, because developments in recent years are more familiar to most contemporary researchers, we end with a brief outline of topics in which new understanding is still actively developing.},

	abstract = {The harmful effects of close inbreeding have been noticed for many centuries (34, 35, 165). With the rise of Mendelian genetics, it was realized that the main genetic consequence of inbreeding is homozygosis (165, Ch. 2). Two main theories were early proposed to account for inbreeding depression and its converse, heterosis (the increase in vigor observed in an F1 between two inbred lines). These are the overdominance and partial dominance hypotheses, discussed in more detail below. Research into this question has continued up to the present, and this is one of the topics that we discuss. Darwin (35, 36) was the first to point out that the evident adaptations of many plants for ensuring outcrossing could be understood in terms of the selective advantage of avoiding inbreeding depression. We review the evidence that the evolution of breeding systems of animals and plants has been significantly influenced by the occurrence of inbreeding depression. In order to do this, we considert he contemporaryg enetic theory of inbreedingd epression and heterosis, and the experimental data concerning the strength of inbreeding depression. We emphasize data and theory relevant to natural, rather than domesticated, populations as we are chiefly concerned to evaluate the evolutionary significance of inbreeding depression. We do not attempt to give a complete bibliography of this very extensive field but try to concentrate on what seem to be the most significant findings in relation to this aim.},

	abstract = {Inbreeding depression - the reduced survival and fertility of offspring of related individuals - occurs in wild animal and plant populations as well as in humans, indicating that genetic variation in fitness traits exists in natural populations. Inbreeding depression is important in the evolution of outcrossing mating systems and, because intercrossing inbred strains improves yield (heterosis), which is important in crop breeding, the genetic basis of these effects has been debated since the early twentieth century. Classical genetic studies and modern molecular evolutionary approaches now suggest that inbreeding depression and heterosis are predominantly caused by the presence of recessive deleterious mutations in populations.},

	abstract = {Inbreeding depression is a major evolutionary and ecological force that influences population dynamics and the evolution of inbreeding-avoidance traits such as mating systems and dispersal. There is now compelling evidence that inbreeding depression is environment-dependent. Here, we discuss ecological and evolutionary consequences of environment-dependent inbreeding depression. The environmental dependence of inbreeding depression may be caused by environment-dependent phenotypic expression, environment-dependent dominance, and environment-dependent natural selection. The existence of environment-dependent inbreeding depression challenges classical models of inbreeding as caused by unconditionally deleterious alleles, and suggests that balancing selection may shape inbreeding depression in natural populations; loci associated with inbreeding depression in some environments may even contribute to adaptation to others. Environment-dependent inbreeding depression also has important, often neglected, ecological and evolutionary consequences: it can influence the demography of marginal or colonizing populations and alter adaptive optima of mating systems, dispersal, and their associated traits. Incorporating the environmental dependence of inbreeding depression into theoretical models and empirical studies is necessary for understanding the genetic and ecological basis of inbreeding depression and its consequences in natural populations.},

	abstract = {Rays and skates are an unavoidable part of the by-catch in demersal fisheries. Over the past 40 years, the thornback ray (Raja clavata) has decreased in numbers and even disappeared in some areas, leading to concerns about genetic risk. For this reason, the effective population size (N(e)), the migration rate (m) and temporal changes in the genetic diversity were estimated for the population of thornback rays in the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel. Using genotyped, archived and contemporary samples (1965 and 2003-2004), N(e) was estimated at 283 individuals (95{\%} CI=145-857), m at 0.1 (95{\%} CI=0.03-0.25) and the N(e)/N ratio between 9 x 10(-5) and 6 x 10(-4). Although these results must be treated with caution, due to the small sample sizes, this is the first attempt to estimate N(e) in an elasmobranch species. The low N(e)/N ratio suggests that relatively few individuals contribute to the next generation. The combined effect of sex bias, inbreeding, fluctuations in population size and, perhaps most important, the variance in reproductive success may explain the low N(e)/N ratio. In addition, the relatively high gene flow between Irish Sea population and other source populations is likely to have had an impact on our estimate, which may be more relevant at the metapopulation scale. No significant loss of genetic diversity was found over the 40-year timeframe and long-term maintenance of the genetic diversity could be due to gene flow.},

A number of studies have presented compelling evidence for key roles of mtDNA in age-related pathology, although many are correlative rather than demonstrating cause. In this review we will evaluate the evidence supporting and opposing a role for mtDNA in age-associated functional declines and diseases.

Our analysis includes home ranges estimated with the convex polygon technique and a recently pro- posed method for eliminating sample size bias. When analyzed separately, neither insectivorous, carnivorous nor female herbivorous lizards had a significant regression of home range size against body mass; male herbivores had a marginally significant regression. Combining data for the dif- ferent foraging types resulted in significant regressions for both males and females; the regression for the pooled data set (males plus females) was also significant. Our regression equations differ significantly from previously published equations derived from home range estimates adjusted for sample size bias. Except for the intercepts of the female regres- sions, our equations do not differ significantly from earlier equations derived from unadjusted home range estimates. Our analysis showed that home range size for the side-blotched lizard, Uta stansburiana, could be accurately determined, without sample size bias, with an average of 13 resightings per lizard},

Little is known, however, of the submarine Galapagos platform on which the islands are built, or of the Cocos and Carnegie submarine ridges produced by past motion of the Cocos and Nazca plates across the hotspot3,4. In 1990 we surveyed selected areas around the Galapagos platform and as far east as 85$\,^{\circ}$30' W on the Carnegie ridge, where we dredged abundant well-rounded basalt cobbles from a small sea-mount with a terraced summit region. Cobbles were also dredged from several other seamounts. We interpret these features, especially the presence of cobbles, as evidence for erosion near sea level and conclude that these seamounts were volcanic islands before subsiding to their present depths. Radiometric ages for these drowned islands range from 5 to 9Myr, consistent with predicted plate motions. They indicate that the time available for speciation of Galapagos organisms is much longer than the age range of the existing islands. {\textcopyright} 1992 Nature Publishing Group.},

	abstract = {Extinction of populations from anthropogenic forces rarely has a single cause. Instead, population declines result from a variety of factors, including habitat loss, inbreeding depression, disease, and climate change. These impacts often have synergistic effects that can lead to rapid decline in isolated populations, but case studies documenting such processes are rare. Here, we describe the recent decline of the last known population of timber rattlesnakes (Crotalus horridus) in the state of New Hampshire. We used polymorphic nuclear DNA markers to compare genetic diversity of this population to other populations in the region that are not isolated. We also compare results from ongoing field monitoring of these populations. Genetic analyses reveal that the New Hampshire population lacks genetic diversity and exhibits signs of a recent bottleneck. New Hampshire snakes also exhibited high levels of morphological abnormalities (unique piebald coloration, amelanistic tongues) indicative of inbreeding depression. Furthermore, after a year with exceptionally high summer rainfall, a skin infection of unknown etiology caused significant mortality in the New Hampshire population, whereas other surveyed non-inbred populations were unaffected. This case study demonstrates how different anthropogenic impacts on natural environments can interact in unexpected ways to drive threatened populations toward extinction. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Results from sequence data revealed extensive haplotype diversity within the red kangaroo (32/34 sequences were unique). Sequence diversity was distributed within rather than between geographical regions across the species range. Genetic connectivity across the range of the species has therefore been maintained over the long term. On a smaller within-region scale, significant genetic structuring was evident from heterogeneity of haplotype frequencies amongst sampling sites. The geographical scale of panmictic populations differed across the continent with more restricted genetic populations occurring in areas with greater topographic and habitat complexity. We propose that these differences in area of genetic populations are the result of population responses to limiting ecological factors during drought.},

	abstract = {A common task for conservation biologists and ecologists is to establish how many individuals there are in a population, usually within a defined area of habitat. Estimates of both absolute and relative population sizes are widely used in many aspects of population conservation and management. Mark--recapture studies are appropriate for estimating the absolute population sizes of a wide range of animals, in both open and closed populations, while relative abundances can be estimated from a variety of survey methods. Relative abundances are often used in a comparative way to compare both population size and fluctuations in abundance. Here, we used transect counts and capture--recapture studies to estimate the relative abundances and population sizes of a specialist butterfly, Theclinesthes albocincta (Lycaenidae) in three habitat fragments, over two consecutive years. The sizes of the three populations differed significantly between sites and were highly variable between years. One population was extremely small and is likely to become locally extinct. We found that estimates of relative abundance were highly correlated with estimates of population size (r2 = 0.88, P = 0.017) derived from the open population models. The combination of transect counts and capture--recapture studies used in this study appears to be a very informative tool for the conservation and management of this butterfly species and could be extended to other insects.},

@article{Colosimo2011,
	abstract = {We show the feasibility of a real-time estimation of waveforms and coseismic displacements, within a few centimeters in accuracy, with a stand-alone dual-frequency Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver using a so-called "variometric" approach. The approach is based on time single-differences of carrier phase observations collected at a high-rate (1 Hz or more) using a stand-alone receiver, and on standard GPS broadcast products (orbits and clocks), which are ancillary information routinely available in real time. In the approach, first, the time series of epoch-by-epoch displacements are estimated. Then, provided that the collected observations are continuous, they can be summed over the interval (limited to a few minutes) over which an earthquake occurs. Since epoch-by-epoch displacements divided by the interval between consecutive epochs are essentially equal to the epoch-by-epoch velocities, this is equivalent to saying that we are using the GPS receiver as a velocimeter. Estimation biases, due to the possible mismodeling of various intervening effects (such as multipath, residual clock errors, orbit errors, and atmospheric errors), accumulate over time and display their signature as a trend in coseismic displacements. The trend can be considered linear and easily removed, at least for short intervals. Since the proposed approach (named VADASE (Variometric Approach for Displacements Analysis Stand-alone Engine)) does not require either additional technological complexity or a centralized data analysis, in principle it can be embedded into GPS receiver firmware, thereby providing a significant contribution to tsunami warning and other hazard assessment systems. After a preliminary test using a simulated example, the effectiveness of this approach was proven using real data. We analyzed the 1 Hz GPS data recorded by the International Global Navigation Satellite Systems Service station BREW during the Denali Fault, Alaska, earthquake (Mw 7.9, 3 November, 2002, 22:12:41 UTC), as well as the 5 Hz data collected by some of the stations of the University NAVSTAR Consortium-Plate Boundary Observatory network and the California Real Time Network during the Baja California, Mexico, earthquake (Mw 7.2, 4 April, 2010, 22:40:42 UTC). Comparisons of the results obtained using VADASE, as well as other already well-established approaches, displayed agreement to within a few centimeters.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Colosimo et al.Ecological data, the primary source of information on patterns and rates of migration, can be integrated with genetic data to more accurately describe the realized connectivity between geographically isolated demes. In this paper we implement this approach and discuss its implications for managing populations of the endangered Andros Island Rock Iguana, Cyclura cychlura cychlura. This iguana is endemic to Andros, a highly fragmented landmass of large islands and smaller cays. Field observations suggest that geographically isolated demes were panmictic due to high, inferred rates of gene flow. We expand on these observations using 16 polymorphic microsatellites to investigate the genetic structure and rates of gene flow from 188 Andros Iguanas collected across 23 island sites. Bayesian clustering of specimens assigned individuals to three distinct genotypic clusters. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicates that allele frequency differences are responsible for a significant portion of the genetic variance across the three defined clusters (Fst = 0.117, p{\%}0.01). These clusters are associated with larger islands and satellite cays isolated by broad water channels with strong currents. These findings imply that broad water channels present greater obstacles to gene flow than was inferred from field observation alone. Additionally, rates of gene flow were indirectly estimated using BAYESASS 3.0. The proportion of individuals originating from within each identified cluster varied from 94.5 to 98.7{\%}, providing further support for local isolation. Our assessment reveals a major disparity between inferred and realized gene flow. We discuss our results in a conservation perspective for species inhabiting highly fragmented landscapes.},

@article{Coltman2003,
	abstract = {Meta-analyses of published and unpublished correlations between phenotypic variation and two measures of genetic variation at microsatellite loci, multilocus heterozygosity (MLH) and mean d2, revealed that the strength of these associations are generally weak (mean r {\textless} 0.10). Effects on life-history trait variation were significantly greater than zero for both measures over all reported effect sizes (r = 0.0856 and 0.0479 for MLH and mean d2, respectively), whereas effects on morphometric traits were not (r = 0.0052 and r = 0.0038), which is consistent with the prediction that life-history traits exhibit greater inbreeding depression than morphometric traits. Effect sizes reported using mean d2 were smaller and more variable than those reported using MLH, suggesting that MLH may be a better metric for capturing inbreeding depression most of the time. However, analyses of paired effect sizes reported using both measures from the same data did not differ significantly. Several lines of evidence suggest that published effects sizes are upwardly biased. First, effect sizes from published studies were significantly higher than those reported in unpublished studies. Second, fail-safe numbers for reported effect sizes were generally quite low, with the exception of correlations between MLH and life-history traits. Finally, the slope of the regression of effect size on sample size was negative for most sets of traits. Taken together, these results suggest that studies designed to detect inbreeding depression on a life-history trait using microsatellites will need to sample in excess of 600 individuals to detect an average effect size (r = 0.10) with reasonable statistical power (0.80). Very few published studies have used samples sizes approaching this value.},

@article{Coltman1999,
	abstract = {-Parasites are thought to provide a selective force capable of promoting genetic variation in natural pop- ulations. One rarely considered pathway for this action is via parasite-mediated selection against inbreeding. If parasites impose a fitness cost on their host and the offspring of close relatives have greater susceptibility to parasites due to the increased homozygosity that results from inbreeding, then parasite-mediated mortality may select against inbred individuals. This hypothesis has not yet been tested within a natural vertebrate population. Here we show that relatively inbred Soay sheep (Ovis aries), as assessed by microsatellite heterozygosity, are more susceptible to parasitism by gastrointestinal nematodes, with interactions indicating greatest susceptibility among adult sheep at high population density. During periods of high overwinter mortality on the island of Hirta, St. Kilda, Scotland, highly parasitised individuals were less likely to survive. More inbred individuals were also less likely to survive, which is due to their increased susceptibility to parasitism, because survival was random with respect to inbreeding among sheep that were experimentally cleared of their gastrointestinal parasite burden by anthelminthic treatment. As a consequence of this selection, average microsatellite heterozygosity increases with age in St. Kildan Soay sheep. We suggest that parasite- mediated selection acts to maintain genetic variation in this small island population by removing less heterozygous individuals},

	abstract = {A febrile response, or a raised body temperature in response to infection, has been widely documented in various species of reptiles in laboratory trials. However, whether and how behavioral fever is achieved in nature remains almost entirely unknown. Here, we examine whether two species of lizard in the cybotoid clade of Hispaniolan trunk-ground anoles (Anolis cybotes and Anolis armouri) change their basking behavior in response to infestation by the chigger mite, Eutrombicula alfreddugesi. We examined body temperature and basking behavior in wild populations of A. cybotes and A. armouri from four localities that spanned a 2,000-m elevational transect in the Sierra de Baoruco, Dominican Republic. Although basking rate increased with elevation, we found that it did not correlate with mite load. Body temperature was also unrelated to parasite load. Thus, we found that E. alfreddugesi infestation did not induce behavioral fever in these anoles. We found a strong altitudinal pattern in chigger infestations: Infestations levels were highest in lizards from mid-elevation and dropped dramatically at low and high elevation (particularly in the latter). We discuss possible mechanisms for this altitudinal pattern in chigger infestation and discuss the relationship between infection and behavioral thermoregulation in lizards.},

Theoretical models assume random dispersal but little is known in practice about the dispersal behaviour of individual animals or the strategy by which dispersers locate distant habitat patches. In the present study, we released individual meadow brown butterflies (Maniola jurtina) in a non-habitat and investigated their ability to return to a suitable habitat. The results provided three reasons for supposing that meadow brown butterflies do not seek habitat by means of random flight. First, when released within the range of their normal dispersal distances, the butterflies orientated towards suitable habitat at a higher rate than expected at random. Second, when released at larger distances from their habitat, they used a non-random, systematic, search strategy in which they flew in loops around the release point and returned periodically to it. Third, butterflies returned to a familiar habitat patch rather than a non-familiar one when given a choice. If dispersers actively orientate towards or search systematically for distant habitat, this may be problematic for existing metapopulation models, including models of the evolution of dispersal rates in metapopulations.},

It uses the Jorde-Ryman modification to the temporal method to account for age structure in populations. This method requires estimates of age-specific survival and birth rate and allele frequencies measured in two or more consecutive cohorts. Allele frequencies are acquired by reading in genotypic data from files formatted for either GENEPOP or TEMPOFS. For each interval between consecutive cohorts, N(e) is estimated at each locus and over all loci. Furthermore, N(e) estimates are output for three different genetic drift estimators (F(s) , F(c) and F(k) ). Confidence intervals are derived from a chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of independent alleles. GONe has been validated over a wide range of N(e) values, and for scenarios where survival and birth rates differ between sexes, sex ratios are unequal and reproductive variances differ.

This was dem- onstrated in a 2 x 3 experiment in which groups of lizards with sealed vo- meronasal ducts or sham-sealed vomeronasal ducts responded to carrot chem- ical stimuli, cologne, and distilled water presented on cotton-tipped appli- cators. Abilities to detect and discriminate food chemicals were abolished in lizards having sealed vomeronasal ducts. For tongue-flick attack score and number of lizards biting, the sham-sealed group responded more strongly to carrot stimuli than to the control stimuli, but the group having sealed ducts did not. Lizards having sham-sealed ducts responded more strongly to carrot stimuli than did lizards having sealed ducts; responses by the two groups of lizards to control stimuli did not differ. Tongue-flicking occurred when the vomeronasal system detected a chemical stimulus from either carrot or col- ogne. Biting occurred only when the vomeronasal organ detected food stimuli (from carrot). Most duct-sealed lizards opened their mouths, some repeat- edly. Mouth-opening thus occurs when the vomeronasal organ does not detect chemicals. It may be an attempt to stimulate or prime the vomeronasal organ or to dislodge the sealant.},

Utilizing molecular marker data, Bayesian mixture models attempt to identify a hidden population structure by clustering individuals into genetically divergent groups, whereas admixture models target at separating the ancestral sources of the alleles observed in different individuals. We discuss the difficulties involved in the simultaneous estimation of the number of ancestral populations and the levels of admixture in studied individuals' genomes. To resolve this issue, we introduce a computationally efficient method for the identification of admixture events in the population history. Our approach is illustrated by analyses of several challenging real and simulated data sets.

In this study, we introduce a novel approach based on recent developments in the estimation of genetic population structure. Our strategy combines analytical integration with stochastic optimization to identify stock mixtures.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the most recent decade many Bayesian statistical models and software for answering questions related to the genetic structure underlying population samples have appeared in the scientific literature. Most of these methods utilize molecular markers for the inferences, while some are also capable of handling DNA sequence data. In a number of earlier works, we have introduced an array of statistical methods for population genetic inference that are implemented in the software BAPS. However, the complexity of biological problems related to genetic structure analysis keeps increasing such that in many cases the current methods may provide either inappropriate or insufficient solutions. RESULTS: We discuss the necessity of enhancing the statistical approaches to face the challenges posed by the ever-increasing amounts of molecular data generated by scientists over a wide range of research areas and introduce an array of new statistical tools implemented in the most recent version of BAPS. With these methods it is possible, e.g., to fit genetic mixture models using user-specified numbers of clusters and to estimate levels of admixture under a genetic linkage model. Also, alleles representing a different ancestry compared to the average observed genomic positions can be tracked for the sampled individuals, and a priori specified hypotheses about genetic population structure can be directly compared using Bayes' theorem. In general, we have improved further the computational characteristics of the algorithms behind the methods implemented in BAPS facilitating the analyses of large and complex datasets. In particular, analysis of a single dataset can now be spread over multiple computers using a script interface to the software. CONCLUSION: The Bayesian modelling methods introduced in this article represent an array of enhanced tools for learning the genetic structure of populations. Their implementations in the BAPS software are designed to meet the increasing need for analyzing large-scale population genetics data. The software is freely downloadable for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X systems at http://web.abo.fi/fak/mnf//mate/jc/software/baps.html.},

	abstract = {Since branch lengths provide important information about the timing and the extent of evolutionary divergence among taxa, accurate resolution of evolutionary history depends as much on branch length estimates as on recovery of the correct topology. However, the empirical relationship between the choice of genes to sequence and the quality of branch length estimation remains ill defined. To address this issue, we evaluated the accuracy of branch lengths estimated from subsets of the mitochondrial genome for a mammalian phylogeny with known subordinal relationships. Using maximum-likelihood methods, we estimated branch lengths from an 11-kb sequence of all 13 protein-coding genes and compared them with estimates from single genes (0.2-1.8 kb) and from 7 different combinations of genes (2-3.5 kb). For each sequence, we separated the component of the log-likelihood deviation due to branch length differences associated with alternative topologies from that due to those that are independent of the topology. Even among the sequences that recovered the same tree topology, some produced significantly better branch length estimates than others did. The combination of correct topology and significantly better branch length estimation suggests that these gene combinations may prove useful in estimating phylogenetic relationships for mammalian divergences below the ordinal level. Thus, the proper choice of genes to sequence is a critical factor for reliable estimation of evolutionary history from molecular data.},

	abstract = {When a population experiences a reduction of its effective size, it generally develops a heterozygosity excess at selectively neutral loci, i.e., the heterozygosity computed from a sample of genes is larger than the heterozygosity expected from the number of alleles found in the sample if the population were at mutation drift equilibrium. The heterozygosity excess persists only a certain number of generations until a new equilibrium is established. Two statistical tests for detecting a heterozygosity excess are described. They require measurements of the number of alleles and heterozygosity at each of several loci from a population sample. The first test determines if the proportion of loci with heterozygosity excess is significantly larger than expected at equilibrium. The second test establishes if the average of standardized differences between observed and expected heterozygosities is significantly different from zero. Type I and II errors have been evaluated by computer simulations, varying sample size, number of loci, bottleneck size, time elapsed since the beginning of the bottleneck and level of variability of loci. These analyses show that the most useful markers for bottleneck detection are those evolving under the infinite allele model (IAM) and they provide guidelines for selecting sample sizes of individuals and loci. The usefulness of these tests for conservation biology is discussed.},

	abstract = {Inbreeding adversely affects fitness traits in many plant and animal species, and the magnitude, stability and genetic basis of inbreeding depression (ID) will have short- and long-term evolutionary consequences. The effects of four degrees of inbreeding (selfing, f=50{\%}; full- and half-sib matings, f=25 and 12.5{\%}; and unrelated outcrosses, f=0{\%}) on survival and growth of an island population of Eucalyptus globulus were studied at two sites for over 14 years. For selfs, ID in survival increased over time, reaching a maximum of 49{\%} by age 14 years. However, their inbreeding depression for stem diameter remained relatively stable with age, and ranged from 28 to 36{\%} across years and sites. ID for survival was markedly greater on the more productive site, possibly due to greater and earlier onset of inter-tree competition, but was similar on both sites for the diameter of survivors. The deleterious trait response to increasing inbreeding coefficients was linear for survival and diameter. Non-significant quadratic effects suggested that epistasis did not contribute considerably to the observed ID at the population level. Among- and within-family coefficients of variation for diameter increased with inbreeding degree, and the variance among the outcrossed families was significant only on the more productive site. The performance of self-families for diameter was highly stable between sites. This suggests that, for species with mixed mating systems, environmentally stable inbreeding effects in open-pollinated progenies may tend to mask the additive genotype-by-environment interaction for fitness traits and the adaptive response to the environment.},

	abstract = {The delimitation of population units is of primary importance in population management and conservation biology. Moreover, when coupled with landscape data, the description of population genetic structure can provide valuable knowledge about the permeability of landscape features, which is often difficult to assess by direct methods (e.g. telemetry). In this study, we investigated the genetic structuring of a roe deer population which recently recolonized a fragmented landscape. We sampled 1148 individuals from a 40 x 55-km area containing several putative barriers to deer movements, and hence to gene flow, namely a highway, rivers and several canals. In order to assess the effect of these landscape features on genetic structure, we implemented a spatial statistical model known as GENELAND which analyses genetic structure, explicitly taking into account the spatial nature of the problem. Two genetic units were inferred, exhibiting a very low level of differentiation (F-ST = 0.008). The location of their boundaries suggested that there are no absolute barriers in this study area, but that the combination of several landscape features with low permeability can lead to population differentiation. Our analysis hence suggests that the landscape has a significant influence on the structuring of the population under study. It also illustrates the use of GENELAND as a powerful method to infer population structure, even in situations of young populations exhibiting low genetic differentiation.},

	abstract = {In this study, we sought to understand how landscape structure affects roe deer movements within their home-range in a heterogeneous and fragmented agricultural system of south-western France. We analysed the movements of 20 roe deer fitted with GPS collars which recorded their locations every 2-6 h over several months (mean = 9 months). Based on empirical observations and previous studies of roe deer habitat use, we hypothesised that roe deer should avoid buildings and roads, move preferentially along valley bottoms and through the more wooded areas of the landscape. To test these hypotheses we paired each observed movement step with 10 random ones. Using conditional logistic regression, we modelled a step selection function, which represents the probability of selecting a given step as a function of these landscape variables. The selected model indicated that movements were influenced by all the tested landscape features, but not always in the predicted direction: our results suggested that roe deer tend to avoid buildings, roads, valley bottoms and possibly the more wooded areas (although the latter result should be interpreted with caution, as it may be influenced by a bias in the rate of GPS fix acquisition in woods). The distances to buildings and to roads were the most influential variables in the model, suggesting that the avoidance of potential sources of disturbance may be a key factor in determining ranging behaviour of roe deer in human dominated landscapes. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

NNI-based local searches are fast but can often get trapped in local optima, whereas it is expected that the larger (but slower to cover) SPR-based neighborhoods will lead to trees with higher likelihood. Here, I verify that PhyML infers more likely trees with SPRs than with NNIs in almost all cases. However, I also show that the SPR-based local search of PhyML often does not succeed at locating the ML tree. To improve the tree space exploration, I deliver a script, named morePhyML, which allows escaping from local optima by performing character reweighting. This ML tree search strategy, named ratchet, often leads to higher likelihood estimates. Based on the analysis of a large number of amino acid and nucleotide data, I show that morePhyML allows inferring more accurate phylogenetic trees than several other recently developed ML tree inference softwares in many cases. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Two general processes may influence gene flow among populations. One involves divergent selection, wherein the maladaptation of immigrants and hybrids impedes gene flow between ecological environments (i.e. ecological speciation). The other involves geographic features that limit dispersal. We determined the relative influence of these two processes in natural populations of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). If selection is important, gene flow should be reduced between different selective environments. If geography is important, gene flow should be impeded by geographic distance and physical barriers. We examined how genetic divergence, long-term gene flow, and contemporary dispersal within a watershed were influenced by waterfalls, geographic distance, predation, and habitat features. We found that waterfalls and geographic distance increased genetic divergence and reduced dispersal and long-term gene flow. Differences in predation or habitat features did not influence genetic divergence or gene flow. In contrast, differences in predation did appear to reduce contemporary dispersal. We suggest that the standard predictions of ecological speciation may be heavily nuanced by the mating behaviour and life history strategies of guppies.},

@article{Crnokrak2002,
	abstract = {Inbreeding depression, the reduction in fitness that accompanies inbreeding, is one of the most important topics of research in evolutionary and conservation genetics. In the recent literature, much attention has been paid to the possibility of purging the genetic load. If inbreeding depression is due to deleterious alleles, whose effect on fitness are negative when in a homozygous state, then successive generations of inbreeding may result in a rebound in fitness due to the selective decrease in frequency of deleterious alleles. Here we examine the experimental evidence for purging of the genetic load by collating empirical tests of rebounds in fitness-related traits with inbreeding in animals and plants. We gathered data from 28 studies including five mammal, three insect, one mollusc, and 13 plant species. We tested for purging by examining three measures of fitness-component variation with serial generations of inbreeding: (1) changes in inbreeding depression, (2) changes in fitness components of inbred lines relative to the original outbred line, and (3) purged population (outcrossed inbred lines) trait means as a function of ancestral outbred trait means. Frequent and substantial purging was found using all three measures, but was particularly pronounced when tracking changes in inbreeding depression. Despite this, we found little correspondence between the three measures of purging within individual studies, indicating that the manner in which a researcher chooses to estimate purging will affect interpretation of the results obtained. The discrepancy suggests an alternative hypothesis: rebounds in fitness with inbreeding may have resulted from adaptation to laboratory conditions and not to purging when using outcrossed inbred lines. However, the pronounced reduction in inbreeding depression for a number of studies provides evidence for purging, as the measure is likely less affected by selection for laboratory conditions. Unlike other taxon-specific reviews on this topic, our results provide support for the purging hypothesis, but firm predictions about the situations in which purging is likely or the magnitude of fitness rebound possible when populations are inbred remain difficult. Further research is required to resolve the discrepancy between the results obtained using different experimental approaches.},

	abstract = {Despite its practical application in conservation biology and evolutionary theory, the cost of inbreeding in natural populations of plants and animals remains to a large degree unknown. In this review we have gathered estimates of inbreeding depression (delta) from the literature for wild species monitored in the field. We have also corrected estimates of delta by dividing by F (coefficient of inbreeding), to take into account the influence that the variation in F will have on delta. Our data set includes seven bird species, nine mammal species, four species of poikilotherms (snakes, fish and snails) and 15 plant species. In total we obtained 169 estimates of inbreeding depression for 137 traits; 81 of those estimates included estimates of F. We compared our mammalian data (limited to those traits related to juvenile mortality) to the estimates for captive zoo species published by Ralls et al. (1988) to determine if, as predicted from the literature, natural estimates of inbreeding depression are higher than captive estimates. The mean delta +/- SE (significantly different from zero and not corrected for F ) for homeotherms was 0.509 +/- 0.081; for poikilotherms, 0.201 +/- 0.039; and for plants, 0.331 +/- 0.038. Levels of inbreeding depression this high in magnitude will be biologically important under natural conditions. When we limited our data set to mortality traits for mammals and corrected for F=0.25 (as is the case for the Ralls et al. data set), we found a significant difference between the two data sets; wild estimates had a substantially higher mean cost of inbreeding at F = 0.25: 2.155 (captive species: 0.314). Of the 169 estimates of delta, 90 were significantly different from zero, indicating that inbred wild species measured under natural conditions frequently exhibit moderate to high levels of inbreeding depression in fitness traits.},

But in celtain respects it is inconsistent with the prin- ciples of common ancestry and vicariance" (e.g., allopatric speciation), and its application to concrete examples of animal distribution generally yields ambiguous results. In the fol- lowing pages' we present a critique of the concept of center of origin, and outline an alter- native conceptual model, involving generalized patterns of biotic distribution (generalized tracks). We assume that a given generalized track estimates an ancestral biota that, be- cause of changing geography, has become subdivided into descendant biotas in localized areas. We assume that in such areas, more or less biotically isolated from one another by barriers to dispersal, the descendant biotas differentiate and produce more modern patterns of taxonomic diversity and distribution. We reject the Darwinian concept of center of origin and its corollary, dispersal of species, as a conceptual model of general applicability in historical biogeography. We admit the reality of dispersal and specify how examples of dispersal may be recognized with reference both to sympatry and to generalized tracks, but we suggest that on a global basis the general features of modern biotic distribution have been determined by subdivision of ancestral biotas in response to changing geography.},

@book{Crow1970,
	abstract = {Many of the ideas current in discussions of problems of evolution and of natural and artificial selection stem from Sewall Wright. Until recently, with the appearance of the first two volumes of Wright's own trilogy see A.B.A., 37, No. 2116 and 39, No. 1331, anyone working with these topics in detail needed to go to the original papers. The gap is further narrowed by this book by two well-known authors. It is aimed primarily at graduate students and the greater part does not require a background of advanced mathematics. The final two chapters, in which gene frequency distributions are introduced, are at a much higher level, and students may find them very heavy weather indeed. Nor are they properly integrated with the rest of the book. For instance, on page 383 the authors discuss, from the stand-point of differential equations, the problem of random drift, and derive expressions very similar to those found by quite different methods on page 337. But no cross reference is made. Nor indeed is the reader given any clue as to why a partial differential equation should possess eigen values and eigen vectors. This could well have been done by the inclusion of a section in which the gene frequency distribution for a population of size 2N is treated as discrete in being able to take 2N+ 1 possible values. Change from generation to generation is then specified by the transition probability matrix. After all, Feller dealt with drift without selection by this method in 1951, and many other workers have used it since. In the past term, I have, with some colleagues, taken a group of graduate students through the book. In doing so, I became aware that in several places the ends were not as neatly tied as I had hoped-very often because the initial assumptions of the treatment were not clearly stated. This is perhaps inevitable when topics are dealt with didactically for the first time, and occurs in discussions of the sub-division of populations, of assortative mating and of effective population size in bisexual populations. I have perhaps tended to take for granted that, by two such authors, the book was bound to be excellent, and have concentrated rather on its deficiencies. May I then say firmly that my original assumption was justified? It is about fifty years since Fisher, Haldane and Wright first began to develop a theory of natural and artificial selection. In view of this, it is perhaps surprising that, arising from evidence from completely new sources such as starch-gel electrophoresis or the sequence of amino acids in peptide chains of various species, arguments should still be so animated about such fundamental problems as the possibility that many of the substitutions which have taken place in evolution may have been non-selective, or as to the reason why so much genetic variation seems to be maintained within random-breeding populations. I suggest that this is because previous theory, at least in its more precise forms, has been too analytical has concentrated too much on the evolution of the parts while forgetting that an organism functions as a whole. Se we have at the moment only the rudiments of a theory of the evolution of the genotype as a unit, or of the phenotype as a unit, bearing in mind now that any particular measurement may be affected by a great many genes. And any satisfactory theory would of course have to deal with the environment as a whole. Perhaps a tall order! Alan Robertson.},

	abstract = {Truncation selection is known to be the most efficient form of directional selection. When this is modified so that the fitness increases linearly over a range of one or two standard deviations of the value of the selected character, the efficiency is reduced, but not greatly. When truncation selection is compared to a system in which fitness is strictly proportional to the character value, the relative efficiency of truncation selection is given by f(c)/sigma, in which f(c) is the ordinate of the frequency distribution at the truncation point and sigma is the standard deviation of the character. It is shown, for mutations affecting viability in Drosophila, that truncation selection or reasonable departures therefrom can reduce the mutation load greatly. This may be one way to reconcile the very high mutation rate of such genes with a small mutation load. The truncation model with directional selection is appropriate for this situation because of the approximate additivity of these mutations. On the other hand, it is doubtful that this simple model can be applied to all genes affecting fitness, for which there are intermediate optima and antagonistic selection among components with negative correlations. Whether nature ranks and truncates, or approximates this behavior, is an empirical question, yet to be answered.},

These controversies were: Wright vs Fisher on Wright's shifting-balance theory; dominance vs overdominance as an explanation of heterosis; the classical vs balance hypothesis for genetic variability; the neutral theory of molecular evolution.

	abstract = {The metaphor of 'genomic islands of speciation' was first used to describe heterogeneous differentiation among loci between the genomes of closely related species. The biological model proposed to explain these differences was that the regions showing high levels of differentiation were resistant to gene flow between species, while the remainder of the genome was being homogenized by gene flow and consequently showed lower levels of differentiation. However, the conditions under which such differentiation can occur at multiple unlinked loci are restrictive; additionally, essentially, all previous analyses have been carried out using relative measures of divergence, which can be misleading when regions with different levels of recombination are compared. Here, we test the model of differential gene flow by asking whether absolute divergence is also higher in the previously identified 'islands'. Using five species pairs for which full sequence data are available, we find that absolute measures of divergence are not higher in genomic islands. Instead, in all cases examined, we find reduced diversity in these regions, a consequence of which is that relative measures of divergence are abnormally high. These data therefore do not support a model of differential gene flow among loci, although islands of relative divergence may represent loci involved in local adaptation.

	abstract = {While the negative effects of inbreeding and reduced heterozygosity on fecundity and survival are well established, only a few investigations have been carried out concerning their influence on morphological traits. This topic is of particular interest for a small and closed population such as the Lipizzan horse. Thus, 27 morphological traits were measured in 360 Lipizzan mares and were regressed on the individual inbreeding coefficients, as well as on the individual heterozygosity and mean squared distances (mean d(2)) between microsatellite alleles within an individual. Both individual heterozygosity and mean d(2) were based on 17 microsatellite loci dispersed over 14 chromosomes. The results obtained by multivariate analysis reveal significant effects of stud (P {\textless}.0001), age at measurement (P {\textless}.0001), and mean d(2) (P =.0143). In univariate analyses, significant associations were obtained between length of pastern-hindlimbs and inbreeding coefficient (P {\textless}.01), length of cannons-hindlimb and mean d(2) (P {\textless}.01), and length of neck and mean d(2) (P {\textless}.001). After adjustment of single-test P values for multiple tests (Hochberg's step-up Bonferroni method), only the association of the length of neck and mean d(2) remained significant (P =.0213). Thus, no overall large effects of inbreeding, microsatellite heterozygosity, and mean d(2) on morphological traits were observed in the Lipizzan horse.},

	abstract = {To investigate ecological influences on cooperative social organization, I studied the four allopatric species of mockingbirds (Nesomimus spp.) endemic to the Gal{\'{a}}pagos archipelago on four islands. On three small, low and arid islands (Genovesa, Champion and Espa{\~{n}}ola), mockingbird territories filled all terrestrial habitat, mean group size varied from 4.5 to 14.2 adults, maximum group size ranged from seven to 24 birds, and 70--100{\%} of groups contained more than two birds. San Crist{\'{o}}bal is larger and higher, and it supports a broader range of habitats. At one highland and two coastal sites on this island, mockingbirds did not hold territories in all available habitats, group size averaged 2.2 adults, only 25{\%} of groups were larger than two, and none included more than three adults. Adults dispersed into vacant habitat to establish new territories only on San Crist{\'{o}}bal. Helping behavior has not yet been observed on San Crist{\'{o}}bal, but it occurs on the other three islands. These results support the hypothesis that social groups and cooperative breeding are maintained where limited availability of preferred habitat constrains dispersal. The mechanism relaxing habitat saturation on San Crist{\'{o}}bal, however, remains undetermined. Predation by introduced rats and cats may reduce survival and indirectly reduce group size; these predators are absent from Genovesa, Champion and Espa{\~{n}}ola. Differences in food supplies could also affect interand intra-island variation in population density. Variation in social organization among arid coastal sites on the four islands, and similarity between climatically different sites on San Crist{\'{o}}bal, suggest that climatic conditions are less important as determinants of dispersal and breeding. Skews in adult sex ratios also fail to account for inter-island variation in sociality. Although they live in a climatically variable environment, territorial behavior and the physical limits of suitable habitat have an overriding influence on cooperative social organization in Gal{\'{a}}pagos mockingbirds. {\textcopyright} 1989, Springer-Verlag.

	abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation are among the largest threats to amphibian populations. However, most studies have not provided clear insights into their population-level implications. There is a critical need to investigate the mechanisms that underlie patterns of distribution and abundance. In order to understand the population- and species-level implications of habitat loss and fragmentation, it is necessary to move from site-specific inferences to assessments of how the influences of multiple factors interact across extensive landscapes to influence population size and population connectivity. The goal of this paper is to summarize the state of knowledge, identify information gaps and suggest research approaches to provide reliable knowledge and effective conservation of amphibians in landscapes experiencing habitat loss and fragmentation. Reliable inferences require attention to species-specific ecological characteristics and their interactions with environmental conditions at a range of spatial scales. Habitat connectivity appears to play a key role in regional viability of amphibian populations. In amphibians, population connectivity is predominantly effected through juvenile dispersal. The preponderance of evidence suggests that the short-term impact of habitat loss and fragmentation increases with dispersal ability. However, species with limited dispersal abilities are likely to be equally imperiled by habitat loss and fragmentation over longer time periods. Rigorous understanding of the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on amphibians will require species-specific, multi-scale, mechanistic investigations, and will be benefit from integrating large empirical field studies with molecular genetics and simulation modeling. Molecular genetic methods are particularly suited to quantifying the influences of habitat structure across large spatial extents on gene flow and population connectivity. Conservation strategies would benefit by moving from generalizations to species and process specific recommendations and by moving from site-specific actions to implementing conservation plans at multiple scales across broad landscapes. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Numerous studies investigate morphology in the context of habitat, and lizards have received particular attention. Substrate usage is often reflected in the morphology of characters associated with locomotion, and, as a result, claws have become well-studied ecomorphological traits linking the two. The Kimberley predator guild of Western Australia consists of 10 sympatric varanid species. The purpose of this study was to quantify claw size and shape in the guild using geometric morphometrics, and determine whether these features correlated with substrate use and habitat. Each species was assigned a Habitat/substrate group based on the substrate their claws interact with in their respective habitat. Claw morphometrics were derived for both wild caught and preserved specimens from museum collections, using a 2D semilandmark analysis. Claw shape significantly separated based on Habitat/substrate group. Varanus gouldii and Varanus panoptes claws were associated with sprinting and extensive digging. Varanus mertensi claws were for shallow excavation. The remaining species? claws reflected specialization for some form of climbing, and differed based on substrate compliance. Varanus glauerti was best adapted for climbing rough sandstone, whereas Varanus scalaris and Varanus tristis had claws ideal for puncturing wood. Phylogenetic signal also significantly influenced claw shape, with Habitat/substrate group limited to certain clades. Positive size allometry allowed for claws to cope with mass increases, and shape allometry reflected a potential size limit on climbing. Claw morphology may facilitate niche separation within this trophic guild, especially when considered with body size. As these varanids are generalist predators, morphological traits associated with locomotion may be more reliable candidates for detecting niche partitioning than those associated directly with diet.},

	abstract = {Information on diameter increment and growth patterns for individual trees are important tools for forest management primarily to: (i) select tree species for logging; (ii) selecting tree species for protection; (iii) estimate cutting cycles and (iv) to prescribe silvicultural treatments. Most growth and yield studies in tropical moist forests have emphasized only the stand level instead of individual trees. This study dealt with the analysis of individual growth patterns for 272 trees distributed over two transects (East-West and North-South) measuring 20 m × 2500 m, which were stratified by plateau, slope and "baixio" (lowland areas near small streams), and tree diameter at breast height (DBH) classes (10 cm ≤ DBH {\textless} 30 cm, 30 cm ≤ DBH {\textless} 50 cm and DBH ≥ 50 cm). For each tree, a metal "dendrometer" band was fixed to the trunk and growth in circumference was measured with digital calipers. Measurements were carried out for 19 months, from June 1999 to December 2000; for this study, only 12 months of year 2000 were considered. Individual growth pattern varied significantly over time (P = 0.00), and slightly (P = 0.08) when the interaction months and DBH classes was included; on the other hand, the signal was very weak (P = 0.25) when topographical classes were added to the later interaction, and no signal at all (P = 0.89) when the interaction between months, diameter and topographical classes were analyzed. Mean annual diameter increment considering all 272 monitored trees was 1.64 $\pm$ 0.21 mm per year (95{\%} CI), falling within the range estimated for the Brazilian Amazon region (1.4-2 mm per year). {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We also employ computer simulations and analytical treatments to determine how microsatellite null alleles might impact molecular parentage analyses. The results indicate that whereas null alleles in frequencies typically reported in the literature introduce rather inconsequential biases on average exclusion probabilities, they can introduce substantial errors into empirical assessments of specific mating events by leading to high frequencies of false parentage exclusions.},

	abstract = {Distribution of mobile organisms on near-continent islands is mainly shaped by factors operating over ecological rather geological time. However, the phylogeography of single species has the potential to expose historical factors at work. In the present study, West Mediterranean populations of the butterfly Maniola jurtina are studied using geometric morphometrics. The distribution of the two well established lineages (Maniola jurtina jurtina in the Atlanto-Mediterranean area and Maniola jurtina janira in the Central-Eastern-Mediterranean area) on 12 islands and the adjoining continents are compared. The south-western lineage unexpectedly occurs on islands close to shores occupied by the eastern lineage. We have modelled the distribution of the lineages using three different hypotheses: (1) a contemporary isolation model, which predicts lineage occupancy of islands is linked to relative distances from neighbouring continental areas; (2) a refugial hypothesis, which predicts one lineage to be the ancestral one for the whole region studied, and then successively replaced over part of it; (3) a changing geography hypothesis, which predicts the two lineages to have evolved in their currently occupied areas, continuously sourcing islands subsequent to the W{\"{u}}rm maximum glaciation. Of the three models, the refugial hypothesis is most highly correlated with the observed pattern, suggesting that Mediterranean islands may function as refugia during cold periods, much as the three mainland peninsulas of Iberia, Italy and Greece are known to have done. Thereafter, hybridization on the nearest and smallest islands has occurred, with the entire process supporting the notion of the joint influence of factors in ecological and geological time. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Linnean Society of London.},

@article{Dapporto2011,
	abstract = {In the western Palaearctic, the Mediterranean zone is an important region where taxa and genes of thermophilous organisms are preserved during glacial stages and new clades are generated. This is achieved through the existence of refugia over Mediterranean Europe and North Africa, where organisms persisted and continued to evolve during the cold phases. However, it is not clear in detail how these refugia function for the maintenance of ancestral taxa, the evolution of new taxa, and as launching pads during postglacial colonizations of northern Europe. One outstanding issue is the incongruence of findings from different marker systems. For the butterfly Maniola jurtina, morphometry and allozyme data analyzed for populations scattered over Europe and North Africa show congruent patterns for Sicily and the Maghreb but produce discrepant results for the Italian mainland. This discrepancy between allozyme and morphological data can be explained by recent gene flow in the wake of postglacial range expansions and shifts. It is evident that colonization histories are far more complex than originally considered. We highlight different aspects of colonization and evolutionary history emerging from the joint use of different marker systems and advocate multiple uses of different markers in paleobiogeographic reconstructions to explore evolu- tionary events and colonization pathways.},

	abstract = {Aim Our aims were to verify the existence of phylogenetic disequilibrium between butterfly lineages at the subcontinental scale for islands and the nearest mainland and to test the capacity of islands for hosting ancestral populations of butterflies and the significance of such relict populations. Location The western Mediterranean continental area of Europe and North Africa together with several large and small islands (Balearics, Tuscan Archipelago, Aeolian Archipelago, Capri, Sardinia, Sicily, Corsica). Methods Using geometric morphometrics, the shape of male genitalia was analysed in two common butterflies (Pyronia cecilia and Pyronia tithonus), whose spatial heterogeneity in the Mediterranean region has recently been described. Observed patterns in genital shapes were compared with shapes predicted for islands and fossil islands to assess the contribution of historical and current events in accounting for the transition from a refugial model to an equilibrium model. Measurements were taken for 473 specimens in 90 insular and mainland sites. Results The shape of the genitalia of populations of most islands differed substantially from that predicted by the equilibrium hypothesis while closely fitting the refugial hypothesis. The comparison between different models strongly suggests that islands maintain ancestral lineages similar to those living in Spain (P. cecilia) and France (P. tithonus). A high correlation between observed and predicted patterns on islands and fossil islands occurs during the first steps of modelled introgressive hybridization while the following steps exposed a successively lower fit, suggesting that the process from a refugial to an equilibrium situation is highly skewed towards an earlier non-equilibrium. Main conclusions The observed non-equilibrium pattern supports the refugial hypothesis, suggesting that an ancestral lineage was originally distributed from Spain to Italy, and also occupied offshore islands. This lineage, replaced in Italy, has persisted on the islands owing to their isolation. A comparison of the distribution patterns for genetic and morphometric markers in several species indicates that the situation highlighted for Pyronia may represent a common biogeographic feature for many Mediterranean butterflies. -� 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd},

Arguing for a material, not divine, origin of species, he showed that new species are achieved by `natural selection'. Development, diversification, decay, extinction, and absence ofplan are all inherent to his theories. Darwin read prodigiously across many fields; he reflected on his experiences as a traveller; he experimented. His profoundly influential concept of `natural selection' condenses materials from past and present, from the Galapagos Islands to rural Staffordshire, from English back gardens tocolonial encounters. The Origin communicates the enthusiasm of original thinking in an open, descriptive style, and Darwin's emphasis on the value of diversity speaks more strongly now than ever.

As with other sequencing-by-synthesis methods, RAD-Seq produces stochastic count data and requires sensitive analysis to develop or genotype markers accurately. We show that there are several sources of bias specific to RAD-Seq that are not explicitly addressed by current genotyping tools, namely restriction fragment bias, restriction site heterozygosity and PCR GC content bias. We explore the performance of existing analysis tools given these biases and discuss approaches to limiting or handling biases in RAD-Seq data. While these biases need to be taken seriously, we believe RAD loci affected by them can be excluded or processed with relative ease in most cases and that most RAD loci will be accurately genotyped by existing tools.$\backslash$n{\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Correlations between allozyme heterozygosity and fitness-related traits, especially growth, have been documented in natural populations of marine bivalves. However, no consistent pattern has been exhibited, because heterotic effects on size vary with age and individual growth parameters are generally unknown. No consensus has emerged on the genetic basis of allozyme-associated heterosis. The species studied here, Spisula ovalis, displays annual shell growth lines, which allows us to compute individual age and growth dynamics over the whole life span. Our morphological study was coupled to a protein electrophoresis study at seven polymorphic loci. While the maximum size gained is not related to heterozygosity, the age at half maximum size, t1/2, is significantly negatively correlated with heterozygosity, indicating an heterotic effect on initial growth. The correlation between heterozygosity and size is expected to vanish when age increases, due to the form of the growth function. This decreasing correlation is consistent with previous studies. We compare the relative performances of five linear models to analyze the genetic basis of heterosis. Surprisingly, the largest part of variance in t1/2 is due to additive effects, the overdominant components being much weaker. Heterosis is therefore due to general genomic effects rather than to local overdominance restricted to allozymes or small neighboring chromosomal segments. A significant dependence of individual heterotic contributions of the enzyme loci upon expected heterozygosities, rather than metabolic function, further supports the hypothesis of enzymes acting as markers. General genomic effects can hold only if allozyme heterozygosity is positively correlated with heterozygosity at fitness-related genes scattered throughout the genome. This hypothesis is supported here by heterozygosity correlations between enzymatic loci.},

	abstract = {Houle (1994) showed that marker-associated heterosis due to general inbreeding depression could not be distinguished from direct overdominance at the marker locus by examining mean genotypic fitnesses, in the one-locus case. Indeed, both hypotheses equally fit the same regression model, referred to as the 'adaptive distance model' (Smouse 1986). I here extend the analysis to several loci and to the relationship between marker genotype and variance in fitness. Several predictions differ between the overdominance and inbreeding hypotheses: (1) all locus-specific effects are equal under inbreeding, whereas they are not under overdominance; (2) the adaptive distance model has an increasingly low fit when the number of loci increases, under inbreeding, whereas it always explains the whole variance in fitness under overdominance; (3) a negative relationship is predicted between mean fitness and the variance in fitness, under inbreeding, which is not predicted under overdominance. Some statistical tests are derived from these predictions, that help to identify the genetic basis of heterosis. Simulations show that the power of these tests allows their application to real datasets.},

	abstract = {Genotypic frequencies at codominant marker loci in population samples convey information on mating systems. A classical way to extract this information is to measure heterozygote deficiencies (FIS) and obtain the selfing rate s from FIS = s/(2 - s), assuming inbreeding equilibrium. A major drawback is that heterozygote deficiencies are often present without selfing, owing largely to technical artefacts such as null alleles or partial dominance. We show here that, in the absence of gametic disequilibrium, the multilocus structure can be used to derive estimates of s independent of FIS and free of technical biases. Their statistical power and precision are comparable to those of FIS, although they are sensitive to certain types of gametic disequilibria, a bias shared with progeny-array methods but not FIS. We analyse four real data sets spanning a range of mating systems. In two examples, we obtain s = 0 despite positive FIS, strongly suggesting that the latter are artefactual. In the remaining examples, all estimates are consistent. All the computations have been implemented in a open-access and user-friendly software called rmes (robust multilocus estimate of selfing) available at http://ftp.cefe.cnrs.fr, and can be used on any multilocus data. Being able to extract the reliable information from imperfect data, our method opens the way to make use of the ever-growing number of published population genetic studies, in addition to the more demanding progeny-array approaches, to investigate selfing rates.},

	abstract = {Cryptic species are similar in morphology, and make interesting subjects for relating morphological differentiation to ecological resource partitioning. Can species that are morphologically almost identical occupy different ecological niches, and hence potentially need distinct conservation planning? The discovery that the most widespread bat in Europe - the pipistrelle - comprised two cryptic species (Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Pipistrellus pygmaeus) that emit echolocation calls at different frequencies provides a remarkable model system for investigating links between morphology, echolocation call design and resource partitioning. We investigated resource partitioning between the two cryptic species of sympatric pipistrelle bats by radio tracking breeding females. Habitat selection was investigated by using compositional analysis. P. pygmaeus selected riparian habitats over all other habitat types in its core foraging areas, whereas P. pipistrellus, although preferring deciduous woodland overall, was more of a generalist, spreading its foraging time in a wider range of habitats. Although morphologically very similar, the cryptic species show quite different patterns of habitat use. Our findings suggest that large-scale differences in habitat preferences can occur between sympatric bat species that are virtually identical in flight morphology; hence morphological differences may be a weak indication of ecological differences between taxa. Conservation planning needs to take account of these differences to meet policy and legal obligations associated with these protected cryptic species. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Blood samples from captured animals were tested for hemoparasites by thin blood smear and molecular analyses.

	abstract = {Like many other migratory birds, the black-throated blue warbler (Dendroica caerulescens) shows pronounced differences in migratory behaviour and other traits between populations: birds in the southern part of the breeding range have darker plumage and migrate to the eastern Caribbean during the winter, whereas those in the north have lighter plumage and migrate to the western Caribbean. We examined the phylogeography of this species, using samples collected from northern and southern populations, to determine whether differentiation between these populations dates to the Pleistocene or earlier, or whether differences in plumage and migratory behaviour have arisen more recently. We analysed variation at 369 bp of the mitochondrial control region domain I and also at seven nuclear microsatellites. Analyses revealed considerable genetic variation, but the vast majority of this variation was found within rather than between populations, and there was little differentiation between northern and southern populations. Phylogeographic analyses revealed a very shallow phylogenetic tree, a star-like haplotype network, and a unimodal mismatch distribution, all indicative of a recent range expansion from a single refugium. Coalescent modelling approaches also indicated a recent common ancestor for the entire group of birds analysed, no split between northern and southern populations, and high levels of gene flow. These results show that Pleistocene or earlier events have played little role in creating differences between northern and southern populations, suggesting that migratory and other differences between populations have arisen very recently. The implications of these results for the evolution of migration and defining taxonomic groups for conservation efforts are discussed.},

	abstract = {Understanding how the intensity of inbreeding depression is influenced by stressful environmental conditions is an important area of enquiry in various fields of biology. In birds, environmental stress during early development is often related to hatching asynchrony; differences in age, and thus size, impose a gradient in conditions ranging from benign (first hatched chick) to harsh (last hatched chick). Here, we compared the effect of hatching order on growth rate in inbred (parents are full siblings) and outbred (parents are unrelated) canary chicks (Serinus canaria). We found that inbreeding depression was more severe under more stressful conditions, being most evident in later hatched chicks. Thus, consideration of inbreeding-environment interactions is of vital importance for our understanding of the biological significance of inbreeding depression and hatching asynchrony. The latter is particularly relevant given that hatching asynchrony is a widespread phenomenon, occurring in many bird species. The exact causes of the observed inbreeding-environment interaction are as yet unknown, but may be related to a decrease in maternal investment in egg contents with laying position (i.e. pre-hatching environment), or to performance of the chicks during sibling competition and/or their resilience to food shortage (i.e. post-hatching environment).

	abstract = {Conservation programmes aim at minimising the loss of genetic diversity, which allows populations to adapt to potential environmental changes. This can be achieved by calculating how many offspring every individual should contribute to the next generation to minimise global coancestry. However, an undesired consequence of this strategy is that it maintains deleterious mutations, compromising the viability of the population. In order to avoid this, optimal contributions could be combined with inbred matings, to expose and eliminate recessive deleterious mutations by natural selection in a process known as purging. Although some populations that have undergone purging experienced reduced inbreeding depression, this effect is not consistent across species. Whether purging by inbred matings is efficient in conservation programmes depends on the balance between the loss of diversity, the initial decrease in fitness and the reduction in mutational load. Here we perform computer simulations to determine whether managing a population by combining optimal contributions with inbred matings improves its long-term viability while keeping reasonable levels of diversity. We compare the management based on genealogical information with management based on molecular data to calculate coancestries. In the scenarios analysed, inbred matings never led to higher fitness and usually maintained lower diversity than random or minimum coancestry matings. Replacing genealogical with molecular coancestry can maintain a larger genetic diversity but can also lead to a lower fitness. Our results are strongly dependent on the mutational model assumed for the trait under selection, the population size during management and the reproductive rate.},

	abstract = {Three approaches for multivariate analysis of fish growth in aquaculture experiments with Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus niloticus L.) based on the von Bertalanffy growth curve are presented and compared. The approaches are: an extended Gulland-and-Holt (GH) plot, a forced extended GH plot and a multilinear regression analysis for the growth parameter K. All three models provide valuable insight into the major environmental factors influencing the daily growth rate and explain 2846{\%} of the variance of the observed daily growth rate of the used data set. For all three methods, the modelled parameter is significantly related to the net yield of Nile tilapia and can, therefore, be used for the predictive modelling of management scenarios. The extended GH plot loads the influence of environmental parameters upon L, while the forced extended GH plot and Direct fitting of K load the influence on the growth parameter K. The latter is more in the tradition of aquaculture research. But the forced extended GH plot and Direct fitting of K can only be applied if L of the cultured species is known, as the selected L influences the variance in the regression variables.},

	abstract = {Protected areas (PAs) are essential for biodiversity conservation, but their coverage is considered inefficient for the preservation of all species. Many species are subdivided into evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) and the effectiveness of PAs in protecting them needs to be investigated. We evaluated the usefulness of the Brazilian PAs network in protecting ESUs of the critically endangered Pithecopus ayeaye through ongoing climate change. This species occurs in a threatened mountaintop ecosystem known as campos rupestres. We used multilocus DNA sequences to delimit geographic clusters, which were further validated as ESUs with a coalescent approach. Ecological niche modeling was used to estimate spatial changes in ESUs' potential distributions, and a gap analysis was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the Brazilian PAs network to protect P. ayeaye in the face of climate changes. We tested the niche overlap between ESUs to gain insights for potential management alternatives for the species. Pithecopus ayeaye contains at least three ESUs isolated in distinct mountain regions, and one of them is not protected by any PA. There are no climatic niche differences between the units, and only 4{\%} of the suitable potential area of the species is protected in present and future projections. The current PAs are not effective in preserving the intraspecific diversity of P. ayeaye in its present and future range distributions. The genetic structure of P. ayeaye could represent a typical pattern in campos rupestres endemics, which should be considered for evaluating its conservation status.},

Different levels of gene flow (Nmtheta) were detected within each species at the scale of the whole Mediterranean: O. montagui and P. platensis had low population structure, with levels of Nmtheta {\textgreater} or = 1, whereas the T. saltator and 0. stephenseni populations have values of Nmtheta {\textless} 1. The relationship between Nmtheta and geographic distance was analyzed to test for the presence of an isolation by distance pattern in the spatial genetic variation within each species. A model of isolation by distance is useful to describe the pattern of genetic structuring of study species at the scale of the whole Mediterranean: geographic distance explained from 28{\%} to 70{\%} of the variation in gene flow. In the Aegean area all species showed an island model of genetic structuring regardless of the levels of gene flow.},

	abstract = {The Island Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma insularis) is found on Santa Cruz Island, California, and is the only insular bird species in the continental United States. We typed seven microsatellite loci and sequenced a portion of the mitochondrial DNA control region of Island Scrub-Jays and their closest mainland relative, the Western Scrub-Jay Aphelocoma californica), to assess levels of variability and effective population size and to examine the evolutionary relationship between the two species. The estimated female effective population size, N-ef, of the Island Scrub-Jay was 1603 (90{\%} confidence interval: 1481 - 1738) and was about 7.5{\%} of the size of the mainland species. Island and Western Scrub-Jays have highly divergent control-region sequences, and the value of 3.14 0.09{\%} sequence divergence between the two species suggests a divergence time of approximately 151,000 years ago. Because the four northern Channel Islands were joined as one large island as recently as 11,000 years ago, extinctions must have occurred on the three other northern Channel islands, Santa Rosa, San Miguel, and Anacapa, highlighting the vulnerability of the remaining population. We assessed the evolutionary significance of four island endemics, including the Island Scrub-Jay, based on both genetic and adaptive divergence. Our results show that the Island Scrub-Jay is a distinct species of high conservation value whose history and adaptive potential is not well predicted by study of other island vertebrates.},

Population structure of the host plant was estimated using allozyme markers and that of the fungus by microsatellites. Both host and parasite showed significant differentiation, but parasite populations were 12 times more strongly differentiated than those of the hosts. We found significant isolation by distance for host populations but not for parasite populations. Higher population differentiation for the parasite may result from small effective population size, high selfing rates, or low migration rate. In this system, hosts are obligate outcrossers and they migrate by seeds and pollen, whereas parasites can self-fertilize and migrate only on pollinating insects. We discuss the effect of limited gene flow in this parasite on its coevolutionary interaction with its host, and its potential for local adaptation on sympatric host populations.},

Although it has been much speculated that this is the consequence of a single horizontal gene transfer (of a proteobacterial or mitochondrial rubisco operon into plastids of rhodophytic and chromophytic algae), neither this hypothesis nor the alternative hypothesis of ancient gene duplication have been examined in detail. We have conducted phylogenetic analyses of all available bacterial rbcL sequences, and representative plastid sequences, in order to explore these alternative hypotheses and fully examine the complexity of rubisco gene evolution. The rbcL phylogeny reveals a surprising number of gene relationships that are fundamentally incongruent with organismal relationships as inferred from multiple lines of other molecular evidence. On the order of six horizontal gene transfers are implied by the form I (L8S8) rbcL phylogeny, two between cyanobacteria and proteobacteria, one between proteobacteria and plastids, and three within proteobacteria. Alternatively, a single ancient duplication of the form I rubisco operon, followed by repeated and pervasive differential loss of one operon or the other, would account for much of this incongruity. In all probability, the rubisco operon has undergone multiple events of both horizontal gene transfer and gene duplication in different lineages.},

We identified ecological opportunity and tested for ecological release in three lizard colonists of White Sands, New Mexico (Sceloporus undulatus, Holbrookia maculata, and Aspidoscelis inornata). First, we provide evidence for ecological opportunity by demonstrating reduced species richness and abundance of potential competitors and predators at White Sands relative to nearby dark soils habitats. Second, we characterize ecological release at White Sands by demonstrating density compensation in the three White Sands lizard species and expanded resource use in White Sands S. undulatus. Contrary to predictions from ecological release models, we observed directional trait change but not increased trait variation in S. undulatus. Our results suggest that ecological opportunity and ecological release can be identified in natural populations, especially those that have recently colonized isolated ecosystems.},

Determining the genetic structure of populations that have not yet declined is an important tool for their conservation. In this study, molecular markers were used to asses the genetic structure of R. boylii. The ND2 region of the mitochondrial genome and Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were examined amongst 51 individuals collected from seven relatively pristine tributaries branching off the Eel River in Northern California. Both markers exhibited significant genetic differentiation among tributaries; however, the RAPD markers revealed a positive correlation between geographic distance and genetic distance. Cluster analysis illustrated a distinct separation between northern and southern tributaries within the study site. In contrast, relatively little geographic structure was apparent when mtDNA haplotypes were examined. Discordance may be caused by the number of loci examined in the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, recent divergence, and sex-biased dispersal.},

	abstract = {Many aspects of parasite biology critically depend on their hosts, and understanding how host-parasite populations are co-structured can help improve our understanding of the ecology of parasites, their hosts, and host-parasite interactions. This study utilized genetic data collected from raccoons (Procyon lotor), and a specialist parasite, the raccoon tick (Ixodes texanus), to test for genetic co-structuring of host-parasite populations at both landscape and host scales. At the landscape scale, our analyses revealed a significant correlation between genetic and geographic distance matrices (i.e., isolation by distance) in ticks, but not their hosts. While there are several mechanisms that could lead to a stronger pattern of isolation by distance in tick vs. raccoon datasets, our analyses suggest that at least one reason for the above pattern is the substantial increase in statistical power (due to the ≈8-fold increase in sample size) afforded by sampling parasites. Host-scale analyses indicated higher relatedness between ticks sampled from related vs. unrelated raccoons trapped within the same habitat patch, a pattern likely driven by increased contact rates between related hosts. By utilizing fine-scale genetic data from both parasites and hosts, our analyses help improve our understanding of epidemiology and host ecology.},

@article{DiFonzo2011,
	abstract = {Heterozygosity has been associated with components of fitness in numerous studies across a wide range of taxa. Because heterozygosity is associated with individual performance it is also expected to be associated with population dynamics. However, investigations into the association between heterozygosity and population dynamics have been rare because of difficulties in linking evolutionary and ecological processes. The choice of heterozygosity measure is a further issue confounding such studies as it can be biased by individual differences in the frequencies of the alleles studied, the number of alleles at each locus as well as the total number of loci typed. In this study, we first examine the differences between the principal metrics used to calculate heterozygosity using long-term data from a marked population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries). Next, by means of statistical transformation of the homozygosity weighted by loci index, we determine how heterozygosity contributes to population growth in Soay sheep by modelling individual contributions to population growth (p(t(i))) as a function of several covariates, including sex, weight and faecal egg count--a surrogate of parasitic nematode burden in the gut. We demonstrate that although heterozygosity is associated with some components of fitness, most notably adult male reproductive success, in general it is only weakly associated with population growth.},

In this study, parts of two mitochondrial genes, 16S rRNA and 12S rRNA, were sequenced to determine the relationships between the sphaerodactylids that live in the Mona Passage and other Caribbean species from the same genus. While the main goal was to identify the biogeographical origin of these species, we also identified a genetically distinct type of dwarf gecko that warrants future evaluation as a possible new species. According to the reconstructed phylogenies, we propose a stepwise model of colonization wherein S. nicholsi from southwestern Puerto Rico or a very close ancestor gave rise through a founder event to Sphaerodactylus monensis on Mona Island. In a similar fashion, S. monensis or a very close ancestor on Mona Island gave rise to S. levinsi on Desecheo Island. This study also suggests that the most recent common ancestor between the species from the islands in the Mona Passage and Puerto Rico existed approximately 3 MYA.},

	abstract = {As a result of reduced intraspecific competition, genetically diverse populations may have higher relative fitness than genetically uniform populations. To test this hypothesis, we compared polyclonal (i. e., genetically diverse) versus monoclonal (i. e., composed of a single clonal genotype) experimental populations of the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis (M{\"{u}}ller, 1786) growing separately and in competition. We estimated the following fitness components: intrinsic growth rate; carrying capacity; proportion of sexual females; diapausing egg production per sexual female and total egg production. Polyclonal populations showed similar dynamics to monoclonal populations and no statistical difference between their fitness components was detected. Therefore, results do not support the hypothesis that genetically diverse populations reduce competition through diversification in resource use. Instead, results suggest that B. plicatilis is a generalist consumer whose polyphagy does not depend on genetic differences, but on the broad diet of each genotype. However, clones showed significant differences in almost all fitness components demonstrating among-clone variation in life-history traits. We found a trade-off between sexual ratio and carrying capacity, highlighting the cost of sex in cyclical parthenogenetic rotifers. We discuss the mechanisms that could maintain the observed among-clone genetic variation in natural populations, and speculate on results implication for sex maintenance in rotifers. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

@article{Dlugosch2008,
	abstract = {Invasive species are predicted to suffer from reductions in genetic diversity during founding events, reducing adaptive potential. Integrating evidence from two literature reviews and two case studies, we address the following questions: How much genetic diversity is lost in invasions? Do multiple introductions ameliorate this loss? Is there evidence for loss of diversity in quantitative traits? Do invaders that have experienced strong bottlenecks show adaptive evolution? How do multiple introductions influence adaptation on a landscape scale? We reviewed studies of 80 species of animals, plants, and fungi that quantified nuclear molecular diversity within introduced and source populations. Overall, there were significant losses of both allelic richness and heterozygosity in introduced populations, and large gains in diversity were rare. Evidence for multiple introductions was associated with increased diversity, and allelic variation appeared to increase over long timescales ({\~{}}100 years), suggesting a role for gene flow in augmenting diversity over the long-term. We then reviewed the literature on quantitative trait diversity and found that broad-sense variation rarely declines in introductions, but direct comparisons of additive variance were lacking. Our studies of Hypericum canariense invasions illustrate how populations with diminished diversity may still evolve rapidly. Given the prevalence of genetic bottlenecks in successful invading populations and the potential for adaptive evolution in quantitative traits, we suggest that the disadvantages associated with founding events may have been overstated. However, our work on the successful invader Verbascum thapsus illustrates how multiple introductions may take time to commingle, instead persisting as a 'mosaic of maladaptation' where traits are not distributed in a pattern consistent with adaptation. We conclude that management limiting gene flow among introduced populations may reduce adaptive potential but is unlikely to prevent expansion or the evolution of novel invasive behaviour.},

Sequences for 13 hard ticks (Family Ixodidae), 5 soft ticks (Family Argasidae), and 2 mesostigmatid mites were obtained from the GenBank database and we generated sequences for 15 hard ticks and 1 holothyrid mite. Ten of these tick species were endemic to Australia. Our analyses indicated that the suborder Holothyrida is more closely related to Ixodida than to Mesostigmata, the group used as outgroup in earlier molecular studies. This finding is consistent with Lehtinen's (1991) hypothesis that the Holothyrida rather than the Mesostigmata is the sister-group to the Ixodida. Within the hard ticks the genus Aponomma and thus the family Amblyomminae were paraphyletic. Taxonomic revision of these taxa is needed. The genus Amblyomma was paraphyletic without the inclusion of "typical" Aponomma species (Ap. latum and Ap. fimbriatum). There was a basal divergence between endemic Australian and other species in both the Metastriata and the Prostriata divisions of the hard ticks.},

In this paper, we review available information on RRT projects involving amphibians and reptiles, examine the motives for advocating RRT strategies, and recommend biological and management criteria that should be considered prior to undertaking RRT projects. Most RRT projects involving amphibians and reptiles have not demonstrated success as conservation techniques and should not be advocated as if they are acceptable management and mitigation practices. We urge caution in accepting claims of success and urge colleagues to publish detailed methods and results of past and ongoing RRT projects.},

	abstract = {The wide range of genetic parameter estimates for production traits and nema- tode resistance in sheep obtained from field studies gives rise to much speculation. Using a mathematical model describing host -- parasite interactions in a genetically heterogeneous lamb population, we investigated the consequence of: (i) genetic relationships between underlying growth and immunological traits on estimated genetic parameters for performance and nema- tode resistance, and (ii) alterations in resource allocation on these parameter estimates. Altering genetic correlations between underlying growth and immunological traits had large impacts on estimated genetic parameters for production and resistance traits. Extreme parameter values ob- served from field studies could only be reproduced by assuming genetic relationships between the underlying input traits. Altering preferences in the resource allocation had less pronounced effects on the genetic parameters for the same traits. Effects were stronger when allocation shifted towards growth, in which case worm burden and faecal egg counts increased and ge- netic correlations between these resistance traits and body weight became stronger. Our study has implications for the biological interpretation of field data, and for the prediction of selec- tion response from breeding for nematode resistance. It demonstrates the profound impact that moderate levels of pleiotropy and linkage may have on observed genetic parameters, and hence on outcomes of selection for nematode resistance.},

We found that growth rates are about the same for the two slopes, but more young Carnegiea were documented on the south-facing than on the north-facing slope, likely due to microclimatic differences and susceptibilities. Fewer individuals were represented in the higher age classes than often found in topographically flat populations. We found that individuals are faster growing on slopes than on flats, likely due to differences in sediment size and make-up. Finally, a recent study linked worldwide volcanism with cohort establishment in topographically flat areas. We found that successful cohort establishment in both populations (north- and south-facing) was significantly higher during years with greater volcanic activity (and the years that were subsequently influenced by airborne materials ejected from the eruption), the first such observation for sloped populations. Volcanic eruptions occurring worldwide impact the regeneration success of this species, and in a variety of topographic settings, extending our previous knowledge of the link between global geologic events and climate change with the regeneration of this species locally (the first ever documented), which with further research will surely be extended to other species in other biomes worldwide. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {From comparative analyses of the nucleotide sequences of genes encoding ribosornal RNAs and several proteins, molecular phylogeneticists have constructed a 'universal- tree of life,' taking it as the basis for a 'natural' hierarchical classification of all living things. Although confidence in some of the tree s early branches has recently been shaken, new approaches could still resolve many methodological uncertainties. More challenging is evidence that most archaeal and bacterial genomes (and the inferred ancestral eukaryotic nuclear genome) contain genes from multiple sources. If 'chimerism' or 'lateral gene transfer' cannot be dismissed as trivial in extent or limited to special categories of genes, then no hierarchical universal classification can be taken as natural. Molecular phylogeneticists will have failed to find the 'true tree,' not because their methods are inadequate or because they have chosen the wrong genes, but because the history of life cannot properly be represented as a tree. However, taxonomies based on molecular sequences will remain indispensable, and understanding of the evolutionary process will ultimately be enriched, not impoverished.},

However, when height-growth data from different populations are compared, the overall shape of the growth curves is similar. In this study, a formula was developed to establish saguaro age-height relationships (using stepwise regression) that can be applied to any saguaro population and only requires a site-specific factor to adjust the curve to the local growth rate. This adjustment factor can be established more efficiently and requires less data than the full analyses required for previous studies. Saguaro National Park East (SNP-E) was used as the baseline factor, set to 1.0. Results yielded a factor of 0.743 for SNP West. When the formula was applied to 10-yr interval data from Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument (OPCNM) in Arizona, USA, this location had a factor of 0.617 (relative to SNP-E). With this formula and relatively little field sampling, the age of any individual saguaro (whether the individual was sampled or not) in any population can be estimated.},

We have assessed the patterns of genomic diversity for ninety feline microsatellite loci among previously characterized populations of cheetahs, lions and pumas in recapitulating demographic history. The results imply that the microsatellite diversity measures (heterozygosity, allele reconstitution and microsatellite allele variance) offer proportionate indicators, albeit with large variance, of historic population bottlenecks and founder effects. The observed rate of reconstruction of new alleles plus the growth in the breadth of microsatellite allele size (variance) was used here to develop genomic estimates of time intervals following historic founder events in cheetahs (12,000 yr ago), in North American pumas (10,000-17,000 yr ago), and in Asiatic lions of the Gir Forest (1000-4000 yr ago).},

We apply the Bayesian skyline plot to simulated data sets and show that it correctly reconstructs demographic history under canonical scenarios. Finally, we compare the Bayesian skyline plot model to previous coalescent approaches by analyzing two real data sets (hepatitis C virus in Egypt and mitochondrial DNA of Beringian bison) that have been previously investigated using alternative coalescent methods. In the bison analysis, we detect a severe but previously unrecognized bottleneck, estimated to have occurred 10,000 radiocarbon years ago, which coincides with both the earliest undisputed record of large numbers of humans in Alaska and the megafaunal extinctions in North America at the beginning of the Holocene.},

We present a new method for relaxing the assumption of a strict molecular clock using Markov chain Monte Carlo to implement Bayesian modeling averaging over random local molecular clocks. The new method approaches the problem of rate variation among lineages by proposing a series of local molecular clocks, each extending over a subregion of the full phylogeny. Each branch in a phylogeny (subtending a clade) is a possible location for a change of rate from one local clock to a new one. Thus, including both the global molecular clock and the unconstrained model results, there are a total of 2(2n-2) possible rate models available for averaging with 1, 2, ..., 2n - 2 different rate categories.},

	abstract = {In phylogenetics, the unrooted model of phylogeny and the strict molecular clock model are two extremes of a continuum. Despite their dominance in phylogenetic inference, it is evident that both are biologically unrealistic and that the real evolutionary process lies between these two extremes. Fortunately, intermediate models employing relaxed molecular clocks have been described. These models open the gate to a new field of "relaxed phylogenetics." Here we introduce a new approach to performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis. We describe how it can be used to estimate phylogenies and divergence times in the face of uncertainty in evolutionary rates and calibration times. Our approach also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness of datasets and comparing this measure between different genes and phylogenies. We find no significant rate autocorrelation among branches in three large datasets, suggesting that autocorrelated models are not necessarily suitable for these data. In addition, we place these datasets on the continuum of clocklikeness between a strict molecular clock and the alternative unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses of 102 bacterial, 106 yeast, 61 plant, 99 metazoan, and 500 primate alignments. From these we conclude that our method is phylogenetically more accurate and precise than the traditional unrooted model while adding the ability to infer a timescale to evolution.},

The Kingman coalescent model is used to describe the time structure of the ancestral tree. We recover information about the unknown true ancestral coalescent tree, population size, and the overall mutation rate from temporally spaced data, that is, from nucleotide sequences gathered at different times, from different individuals, in an evolving haploid population. We briefly discuss the methodological implications and show what can be inferred, in various practically relevant states of prior knowledge. We develop extensions for exponentially growing population size and joint estimation of substitution model parameters. We illustrate some of the important features of this approach on a genealogy of HIV-1 envelope (env) partial sequences.},

	abstract = {Parasites and hosts interact across both micro- and macroevolutionary scales where congruence among their phylogeographic and phylogenetic structures may be observed. Within southern Africa, the four-striped mouse genus, Rhabdomys, is parasitized by the ectoparasitic sucking louse, Polyplax arvicanthis. Molecular data recently suggested the presence of two cryptic species within P. arvicanthis that are sympatrically distributed across the distributions of four putative Rhabdomys species. We tested the hypotheses of phylogeographic congruence and cophylogeny among the two parasite lineages and the four host taxa, utilizing mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data. Despite the documented host-specificity of P. arvicanthis, limited phylogeographic correspondence and nonsignificant cophylogeny was observed. Instead, the parasite-host evolutionary history is characterized by limited codivergence and several duplication, sorting and host-switching events. Despite the elevated mutational rates found for P. arvicanthis, the spatial genetic structure was not more pronounced in the parasite lineages compared with the hosts. These findings may be partly attributed to larger effective population sizes of the parasite lineages, the vagility and social behaviour of Rhabdomys, and the lack of host-specificity observed in areas of host sympatry. Further, the patterns of genetic divergence within parasite and host lineages may also be largely attributed to historical biogeographic changes (expansion-contraction cycles). It is thus evident that the association between P. arvicanthis and Rhabdomys has been shaped by the synergistic effects of parasite traits, host-related factors and biogeography over evolutionary time.},

@article{Dudek2016,
	abstract = {The success of ectoparasites depends primarily on the site of attachment and body condition of their hosts. Ticks usually tend to aggregate on vertebrate hosts in specific areas, but the distribution pattern may depend on host body size and condition, sex, life stage or skin morphology. Here, we studied the distribution of ticks on lizards and tested the following hypothesis: occurrence or high abundance of ticks is confined with body parts with smaller scales and larger interscalar length because such sites should provide ticks with superior attachment conditions. This study was performed in field conditions in central Poland in 2008-2011. In total, 500 lizards (Lacerta agilis) were caught and 839 ticks (Ixodes ricinus, larvae and nymphs) were collected from them. Using generalised linear mixed models, we found that the ticks were most abundant on forelimbs and their axillae, with 90{\%} of ticks attached there. This part of the lizard body and the region behind the hindlimb were covered by the smallest scales with relatively wide gaps between them. This does not fully support our hypothesis that ticks prefer locations with easy access to skin between scales, because it does not explain why so few ticks were in the hindlimb area. We found that the abundance of ticks was positively correlated with lizard body size index (snout-vent length). Tick abundance was also higher in male and mature lizards than in female and young individuals. Autotomy had no effect on tick abundance. We found no correlation between tick size and lizard morphology, sex, autotomy and body size index. The probability of occurrence of dead ticks was positively linked with the total number of ticks on the lizard but there was no relationship between dead tick presence and lizard size, sex or age. Thus lizard body size and sex are the major factors affecting the abundance of ticks, and these parasites are distributed nearly exclusively on the host's forelimbs and their axillae.},

Squeezing movements did not begin until intromission had occurred and, contrary to predictions of the conflict-of-interest hypothesis for genitalic evolution, did not overcome morphological or behavioral female resistance. Contrary to predictions of the lock-and-key hypothesis, female morphology was uniform in the two species and could not mechanically exclude the genitalia of either species of male. The complex pattern of squeezing movements differed between the two species as predicted by the sexual selection hypothesis for genitalic evolution. Also, evolutionarily derived muscles and pseudoarticulations in the male's genitalic surstyli facilitated one type of movement, whose patterns were especially distinct. The data support the hypothesis that the male surstyli evolved to function as courtship devices.},

We suggest the use of principal coordinate analysis (PCO, metric MDS), followed by either a canonical discriminant analysis (CDA, when the hypothesis concerns groups) or a canonical correlation analysis (CCorA, when the hypothesis concerns relationships with environmental or other variables), to provide a flexible and meaningful constrained ordination of ecological species abundance data. Called "CAP" for "Canonical Analysis of Principal coordinates," this method will allow a constrained ordination to be done on the basis of any distance or dissimilarity measure. We describe CAP in detail, including how it can uncover patterns that are masked in an unconstrained MDS ordination. Canonical tests using permutations are also given, and we show how the method can be used (1) to place a new observation into the canonical space using only interpoint dissimilarities, (2) to classify observations and obtain misclassification or residual errors, and (3) to correlate the original variables with patterns on canonical plots. Misclassification error or residual error is used to obtain a non-arbitrary decision concerning the appropriate dimensionality of the response data cloud (number of PCO axes) for the ensuing canonical analysis. We suggest that a CAP ordination and an unconstrained ordination, such as MDS, together will provide important information for meaningful multivariate analyses of ecological data by reference to explicit a priori hypotheses.},

Previous studies identified three genomic regions - survivorship quantitative trait loci (QTLs) - that were under strong selection in experimental hybrids transplanted into the natural habitat of H. paradoxus. Here we ask whether these same genomic regions experienced significant selection during the origin and evolution of the natural hybrid, H. paradoxus. This was accomplished by comparing the variability of microsatellites linked to the three survivorship QTLs with those from genomic regions that were neutral in the experimental hybrids. As predicted if one or more selective sweeps had occurred in these regions, microsatellites linked to the survivorship QTLs exhibited a significant reduction in diversity in populations of the natural hybrid species. In contrast, no difference in diversity levels was observed between the two microsatellite classes in parental populations.},

	abstract = {As populations become increasingly fragmented, managers are often faced with the dilemma that intentional hybridization might save a population from inbreeding depression but it might also induce outbreeding depression. While empirical evidence for inbreeding depression is vastly greater than that for outbreeding depression, the available data suggest that risks of outbreeding, particularly in the second generation, are on par with the risks of inbreeding. Predicting the relative risks in any particular situation is complicated by variation among taxa, characters being measured, level of divergence between hybridizing populations, mating history, environmental conditions and the potential for inbreeding and outbreeding effects to be occurring simultaneously. Further work on consequences of interpopulation hybridization is sorely needed with particular emphasis on the taxonomic scope, the duration of fitness problems and the joint effects of inbreeding and outbreeding. Meanwhile, managers can minimize the risks of both inbreeding and outbreeding by using intentional hybridization only for populations clearly suffering from inbreeding depression, maximizing the genetic and adaptive similarity between populations, and testing the effects of hybridization for at least two generations whenever possible.},

@article{Edwards2005,
	abstract = {Molecular studies of speciation in birds over the last three decades have been dominated by a focus on the geography, ecology, and timing of speciation, a tradition traceable to Mayr's Systematics and the Origin of Species. However, in the recent years, interest in the behavioral and molecular mechanisms of speciation in birds has increased, building in part on the older traditions and observations from domesticated species. The result is that many of the same mechanisms proffered for model lineages such as Drosophila--mechanisms such as genetic incompatibilities, reinforcement, and sexual selection--are now being seriously entertained for birds, albeit with much lower resolution. The recent completion of a draft sequence of the chicken genome, and an abundance of single-nucleotide polymorphisms on the autosomes and sex chromosomes, will dramatically accelerate research on the molecular mechanisms of avian speciation over the next few years. The challenge for ornithologists is now to inform well studied examples of speciation in nature with increased molecular resolution-to clone speciation genes if they exist--and thereby evaluate the relative roles of extrinsic, intrinsic, deterministic, and stochastic causes for avian diversification.},

It is shown that migration of one or few individuals per generation is insufficient for leveling differences between subpopulations in allele frequencies. Even if migration is estimated as m = 0.5 (exchange of 50 and 500 individuals per generation) statistically significant differences remain at least in the half of populations with insular structure. Spatial heterogeneity disappears completely only if m = 0.7-0.8. In case of two-dimensional step model the level of genetic differentiation is higher and statistically significant heterogeneity remains at all levels of genetic exchange including that which was estimated as m = 1},

Two of them, Mitrapus oblongus (Pillai, 1964) and Clavellisa ilishae Pillai, 1962, are of Indo-Pacific origin and are considered here to have co-invaded the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal on Erythrean (Red Sea) immigrant hosts. Both are reported here from native Mediterranean clupeid fish hosts; this is the first evidence of host switching of any metazoan parasites from Erythrean immigrants to native fish hosts. The third parasite, Nothobomolochus fradei Marques, 1965, was previously known from the Gulf of Guinea and the Arabian Gulf. Possible explanations of its presence on clupeid hosts in Egyptian waters off Alexandria are discussed. The parasite utilizes an Erythrean immigrant clupeid and a native Mediterranean species as hosts. This account provides evidence of parasite and host faunal mixing on an unexpected scale.},

Genetic evidence of population subdivision can be observed even when gene flow is very high, if the offspring distribution is skewed. A skewed offspring distribution arises when individuals can have very many offspring with some probability. This leads to high probability of identity by descent within subpopulations and results in genetic heterogeneity between subpopulations even when Nm is very large. Thus, we consider a limiting model in which the rates of coalescence and migration can be much higher than for a Wright-Fisher population. We derive the densities of pairwise coalescence times and expressions for F(ST) and other statistics under both the finite island model and a many-demes limit model. The results can explain the observed genetic heterogeneity among subpopulations of certain marine organisms despite substantial gene flow.},

	abstract = {Migratory birds are known to play a role as long-distance vectors for many microorganisms. To investigate whether this is true of rickettsial agents as well, we characterized tick infestation and gathered ticks from 13,260 migratory passerine birds in Sweden. A total of 1127 Ixodes spp. ticks were removed from these birds and the extracted DNA from 957 of them was available for analyses. The DNA was assayed for detection of Rickettsia spp. using real-time PCR, followed by DNA sequencing for species identification. Rickettsia spp. organisms were detected in 108 (11.3{\%}) of the ticks. Rickettsia helvetica, a spotted fever rickettsia associated with human infections, was predominant among the PCR-positive samples. In 9 (0.8{\%}) of the ticks, the partial sequences of 17kDa and ompB genes showed the greatest similarity to Rickettsia monacensis, an etiologic agent of Mediterranean spotted fever-like illness, previously described in southern Europe as well as to the Rickettsia sp.IrITA3 strain. For 15 (1.4{\%}) of the ticks, the 17kDa, ompB, gltA and ompA genes showed the greatest similarity to Rickettsia sp. strain Davousti, Rickettsia japonica and Rickettsia heilongjiangensis, all closely phylogenetically related, the former previously found in Amblyomma tholloni ticks in Africa and previously not detected in Ixodes spp. ticks. The infestation prevalence of ticks infected with rickettsial organisms was four times higher among ground foraging birds than among other bird species, but the two groups were equally competent in transmitting Rickettsia species. The birds did not seem to serve as reservoir hosts for Rickettsia spp., but in one case it seems likely that the bird was rickettsiemic and that the ticks had acquired the bacteria from the blood of the bird. In conclusion, migratory passerine birds host epidemiologically important vector ticks and Rickettsia species and contribute to the geographic distribution of spotted fever rickettsial agents and their diseases.},

Such high rates mean that spontaneous mutations that form new-length variants can realistically be seen in pedigree analysis. Data on observed mutation events from various organisms are now accumulating, allowing inferences on DNA sequence evolution to be made through an unusually direct approach. Here I discuss and integrate microsatellite mutation data in an evolutionary context. A striking feature of the mutation process is that it seems highly heterogeneous, with distinct differences between species, repeat types, loci and alleles. Age and sex also affect the mutation rate. Within genomes at equilibrium, the microsatellite-length distribution is a delicate balance between biased mutation processes and point mutations acting towards the decay of repetitive DNA.

	abstract = {Elucidating the connection between genotype, phenotype, and adaptation in wild populations is fundamental to the study of evolutionary biology, yet it remains an elusive goal, particularly for microscopic taxa, which comprise the majority of life. Even for microbes that can be reliably found in the wild, defining the boundaries of their populations and discovering ecologically relevant phenotypes has proved extremely difficult. Here, we have circumvented these issues in the microbial eukaryote Neurospora crassa by using a "reverse-ecology" population genomic approach that is free of a priori assumptions about candidate adaptive alleles. We performed Illumina whole-transcriptome sequencing of 48 individuals to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms. From these data, we discovered two cryptic and recently diverged populations, one in the tropical Caribbean basin and the other endemic to subtropical Louisiana. We conducted high-resolution scans for chromosomal regions of extreme divergence between these populations and found two such genomic "islands." Through growth-rate assays, we found that the subtropical Louisiana population has a higher fitness at low temperature (10 $\,^{\circ}$C) and that several of the genes within these distinct regions have functions related to the response to cold temperature. These results suggest the divergence islands may be the result of local adaptation to the 9 $\,^{\circ}$C difference in average yearly minimum temperature between these two populations. Remarkably, another of the genes identified using this unbiased, whole-genome approach is the well-known circadian oscillator frequency, suggesting that the 2.4$\,^{\circ}$-10.6$\,^{\circ}$ difference in latitude between the populations may be another important environmental parameter.},

	abstract = {Where fecundity, mortality, immigration, or emigration differ among species, genotypes, environments, sexes, or age and size classes, we must expect differences in the composition and dynamics of populations and communities. However, as shown in this study on all-hybrid populations of the herniclonal waterfrog Pelophylax esculentus, the reverse conclusion is not necessarily true: Population differences in genotype composition were not paralleled by differences in genotype-specific age and size distributions. We investigated 12 ponds with different ratios of diploid (LR) and triploid (LLR and LRR) hybrids and tested whether the pond-to-pond ratio differences result from differential survival of the three genotypes under different ecological conditions (selection hypothesis). This should then be reflected in the age and size distribution of the frogs. Age (determined through skeletochronology) and size (measured as snout vent length) were related to eight ecological variables that in previous studies had been found to affect genotype ratios: temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, pond size, amounts of submerged and floating pond vegetation, and proportions of forest and wetland area within 20 m of the pond. Only two of these eight variables had a significant effect on growth and survival: frogs in larger ponds were, on average, older and larger than frogs in smaller ponds, and body size also increased with water temperature. Since these relationships did not differ between genotypes and sexes, we conclude that ecological conditions are unlikely to exert their influence on population structure via differential individual performance. The conclusion is supported by our finding that across the 12 study ponds there was no significant relationship between the proportion of a particular genotype x sex category and the average age and size of the individuals belonging to that category. An alternative to the selection hypothesis is offered by the recently proposed gamete pattern hypothesis. It states that pond-to-pond differences in genotype ratios arise from different gamete production patterns of LLB, LR, and LLR males and females. But, so far, support for this hypothesis is also weak.},

	abstract = {Effective population size (Ne) is a central concept in evolutionary biology and conservation genetics. It predicts rates of loss of neutral genetic variation, fixation of deleterious and favourable alleles, and the increase of inbreeding experienced by a population. A method exists for the estimation of Ne from the observed linkage disequilibrium between unlinked loci in a population sample.While an increasing number of studies have applied this method in natural and managed populations, its reliability has not yet been evaluated. We developed a computer program to calculate this estimator of Ne using the most widely used linkage disequilibrium algorithm and used simulations to show that this estimator is strongly biased when the sample size is small ({\textless}100) and below the true Ne. This is probably due to the linkage disequilibrium generated by the sampling process itself and the inadequate correction for this phenomenon in the method. Results suggest that Ne estimates derived using this method should be regarded with caution in many cases. To improve the method's reliability and usefulness we propose a way to determine whether a given sample size exceeds the population Ne and can therefore be used for the computation of an unbiased estimate.},

Detecting population fragmentation is therefore crucial for conservation management. Using computer simulations, we show that a single sample estimator of Ne based on linkage disequilibrium is a highly sensitive and promising indicator of recent population fragmentation and bottlenecks, even with some continued gene flow. For example, fragmentation of a panmictic population of Ne = 1,000 into demes of Ne = 100 can be detected with high probability after a single generation when estimates from this method are compared to prefragmentation esti- mates, given data for*20 microsatellite loci in samples of 50 individuals. We consider a range of loci (10--40) and individuals (25--100) typical of current studies of natural populations and show that increasing the number of loci gives nearly the same increase in precision as increasing the number of individuals sampled. We also evaluated effects of incomplete fragmentation and found this Ne-reduction signal is still apparent in the presence of considerable migration (m * 0.10--0.25). Single-sample genetic estimates of Ne thus show considerable promise for early detection of population fragmentation and decline.},

As a consequence, G. polyphemus may have experienced population bottlenecks that resulted in a decrease in genetic diversity and an accumulation of deleterious alleles. The importance of genetic diversity has been well-documented for several fitness parameters (e.g., survival, disease resistance, growth and developmental rates, and developmental instability). Western populations of G. polyphemus in south Mississippi (USA) have lower hatching success (16.7--48{\%}) than that found in eastern populations (67-- 97{\%}). Even under laboratory conditions, approximately 40{\%} of the eggs still failed to hatch, suggesting that intrinsic (egg quality) factors may be affecting development. Using nine microsatellite loci, we genotyped individuals from four populations in south Mississippi and one eastern population (Fort Benning, GA) and compared several genetic diversity indices (e.g., allelic richness, expected heterozygosity, and percent polymorphic loci) with published data from populations in the eastern portion of the range, such as populations east of the Mobile and Tombigbee rivers. We found significantly lower genetic diversity in the four Mississippi populations than in the eastern populations. However, these findings only demonstrate that these populations have low genetic diversity, and establishing any causal relationship between low genetic diversity (or other intrinsic factors; e.g., female condition) and reduced reproductive success should be further investigated},

Cholesterol and five carboxylic acids (tetradecanoic, hexadecanoic, hexadecenoic, octadecanoic, and Z-9-octadecenoic) appeared in all species. The number of precloacal pores correlated positively with altitude and negatively with latitude, suggesting that lizards produce more secretions under harsh environments.},

	abstract = {Understanding how parental distance affects offspring fitness, i.e., the effects of inbreeding and outbreeding in natural populations, is a major goal in evolutionary biology. While inbreeding is often associated with fitness reduction (inbreeding depression), interpopulation outcrossing may have either positive (heterosis) or negative (outbreeding depression) effects. Within a metapopulation, all phenomena may occur with various intensities depending on the focal population (especially its effective size) and the trait studied. However, little is known about interpopulation variation at this scale. We here examine variation in inbreeding depression, heterosis, and outbreeding depression on life-history traits across a full-life cycle, within a metapopulation of the hermaphroditic snail Physa acuta. We show that all three phenomena can co-occur at this scale, although they are not always expressed on the same traits. A large variation in inbreeding depression, heterosis, and outbreeding depression is observed among local populations. We provide evidence that, as expected from theory, small and isolated populations enjoy higher heterosis upon outcrossing than do large, open populations. These results emphasize the need for an integrated theory accounting for the effects of both deleterious mutations and genetic incompatibilities within metapopulations and to take into account the variability of the focal population to understand the genetic consequences of inbreeding and outbreeding at this scale.},

	abstract = {Homoplasy has recently attracted the attention of population geneticists, as a consequence of the popularity of highly variable stepwise mutating markers such as microsatellites. Microsatellite alleles generally refer to DNA fragments of different size (electromorphs). Electromorphs are identical in state (i.e. have identical size), but are not necessarily identical by descent due to convergent mutation(s). Homoplasy occurring at microsatellites is thus referred to as size homoplasy. Using new analytical developments and computer simulations, we first evaluate the effect of the mutation rate, the mutation model, the effective population size and the time of divergence between populations on size homoplasy at the within and between population levels. We then review the few experimental studies that used various molecular techniques to detect size homoplasious events at some microsatellite loci. The relationship between this molecularly accessible size homoplasy size and the actual amount of size homoplasy is not trivial, the former being considerably influenced by the molecular structure of microsatellite core sequences. In a third section, we show that homoplasy at microsatellite electromorphs does not represent a significant problem for many types of population genetics analyses realized by molecular ecologists, the large amount of variability at microsatellite loci often compensating for their homoplasious evolution. The situations where size homoplasy may be more problematic involve high mutation rates and large population sizes together with strong allele size constraints.},

	abstract = {Fungal symbionts that live asymptomatically inside plant tissues (endophytes) can influence plant-insect interactions. Recent work has shown that damage by leaf-cutting ants, a major Neotropical defoliator, is reduced to almost half in plants with high densities of endophytes. We investigated changes in the phenotype of leaves that could influence ants' behavior to result in the reduction of foliar damage. We produced cucumber seedlings with high and low densities of one common endophyte species, Colletotrichum tropicale. We used the leaves in bioassays and to compare chemical and physical leaf characteristics important for ants' food selection. Ants cut about one-third more area of cucumber leaves with lower densities of endophytes and removed c. 20{\%} more paper disks impregnated with the extracts of those leaves compared with leaves and disks from plants hosting the fungus. Colletotrichum tropicale colonization did not cause detectable changes in the composition of volatile compounds, cuticular waxes, nutrients or leaf toughness. Our study shows that endophytes changed leaf chemistry and suggests that compounds with relative low volatility released after leaf wounding are a major factor influencing foraging decisions by ants when choosing between plants with low or high endophyte loads.},

Intraspecific and intrageneric variation in the region of the sternum and xiphisternum is very great, leaving no osteological basis for recognition of the "urosaurine" and "utiform" generic groups proposed by Savage (1958). Petrosaurus is osteologically the most distinctive genus; it is not more similar to Uta than to other sceloporine genera. Osteological comparisons of Uta and Urosaurus do not provide a strong argument either for or against their recognition as separate genera. Three subgroups are recognized within the sceloporines: (1) Petrosaurus with 4 sternal ribs (3 in the others), (2) Uta, Urosaurus, Sator, and Sceloporus with hook-like processes on the clavicle, and (3) Callisaurus, Holbrookia, and Uma with 2 cervical ribs (3 in the others). Phrynosoma differs from the sceloporines in many characteristics of skeletal and external morphology, and the genus is removed from the sceloporine group where it was placed by Savage (1958). The skeletal characters of the iguanine group of genera proposed by Savage (1958) (Iguana, Ctenosaura, Enyaliosaurus, Cyclura, Dipsosaurus, Sauromalus, Amblyrhynchus, Conolophus, Crotaphytus, and Brachylophus) are described, and Crotaphytus is removed from the group. Comparison of sceloporines with iguanines indicates that they are not closely related. Of the iguanid genera of North and Central America, the most similar to the sceloporines is Crotaphytus. Of the sceloporines, Petrosaurus is most similar to Crotaphytus. The skeletal characters of the West Indian and South American genera Leiocephalus, Hispaniolus, Liolaemus, Stenocercus, Tropidurus, Uranoscodon, Plica, Urocentron, Platynotus, Proctotretus, and Ctenoblepharis are briefly described, and the group name "tropidurine" is applied to them.

A recent Bayesian algorithm implemented in the software STRUCTURE allows the identification of such groups. However, the ability of this algorithm to detect the true number of clusters (K) in a sample of individuals when patterns of dispersal among populations are not homogeneous has not been tested. The goal of this study is to carry out such tests, using various dispersal scenarios from data generated with an individual-based model. We found that in most cases the estimated 'log probability of data' does not provide a correct estimation of the number of clusters, K. However, using an ad hoc statistic DeltaK based on the rate of change in the log probability of data between successive K values, we found that STRUCTURE accurately detects the uppermost hierarchical level of structure for the scenarios we tested. As might be expected, the results are sensitive to the type of genetic marker used (AFLP vs. microsatellite), the number of loci scored, the number of populations sampled, and the number of individuals typed in each sample.},

	abstract = {The authors present ELB, an easy to programme and computationally fast algorithm for inferring gametic phase in population samples of multilocus genotypes. Phase updates are made on the basis of a window of neighbouring loci, and the window size varies according to the local level of linkage disequilibrium. Thus, ELB is particularly well suited to problems involving many loci and/or relatively large genomic regions, including those with variable recombination rate. The authors have simulated population samples of single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes with varying levels of recombination and marker density, and find that ELB provides better local estimation of gametic phase than the PHASE or HTYPER programs, while its global accuracy is broadly similar. The relative improvement in local accuracy increases both with increasing recombination and with increasing marker density. Short tandem repeat (STR, or microsatellite) simulation studies demonstrate ELB's superiority over PHASE both globally and locally. Missing data are handled by ELB; simulations show that phase recovery is virtually unaffected by up to 2 per cent of missing data, but that phase estimation is noticeably impaired beyond this amount. The authors also applied ELB to datasets obtained from random pairings of 42 human X chromosomes typed at 97 diallelic markers in a 200 kb low-recombination region. Once again, they found ELB to have consistently better local accuracy than PHASE or HTYPER, while its global accuracy was close to the best.},

	abstract = {We present here a framework for the study of molecular variation within a single species. Information on DNA haplotype divergence is incorporated into an analysis of variance format, derived from a matrix of squared-distances among all pairs of haplotypes. This analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) produces estimates of variance components and F-statistic analogs, designated here as phi-statistics, reflecting the correlation of haplotypic diversity at different levels of hierarchical subdivision. The method is flexible enough to accommodate several alternative input matrices, corresponding to different types of molecular data, as well as different types of evolutionary assumptions, without modifying the basic structure of the analysis. The significance of the variance components and phi-statistics is tested using a permutational approach, eliminating the normality assumption that is conventional for analysis of variance but inappropriate for molecular data. Application of AMOVA to human mitochondrial DNA haplotype data shows that population subdivisions are better resolved when some measure of molecular differences among haplotypes is introduced into the analysis. At the intraspecific level, however, the additional information provided by knowing the exact phylogenetic relations among haplotypes or by a nonlinear translation of restriction-site change into nucleotide diversity does not significantly modify the inferred population genetic structure. Monte Carlo studies show that site sampling does not fundamentally affect the significance of the molecular variance components. The AMOVA treatment is easily extended in several different directions and it constitutes a coherent and flexible framework for the statistical analysis of molecular data.},

	abstract = {The distribution of the Galapagos land iguanas Conolophus subcristatus has been strongly affected by human activities in the last century. Previously widespread throughout the whole archipelago, today they inhabit only few islands, with populations often small and isolated. In this study, we analyzed the population genetic structure of land iguanas from Santa Cruz Island to investigate the genetic implications of a semi-captive conservation program that started in middle 1970s and is still ongoing. Nine microsatellites were used to measure the level of genetic variability and to detect potential evidence of inbreeding and genetic sub-structure. Furthermore, we used approximate Bayesian computation, together with software packages for coalescent-based simulations, to test a priori hypotheses in different demographic scenarios. Despite the abrupt reduction in size of the original population, no evidence of inbreeding was found, and the levels of genetic variability were similar to those of undisturbed populations of the archipelago. Nevertheless, the source and the repatriated populations started differentiating (F(ST)=0.016) and genetic sub-structure was found.

	abstract = {Bottlenecks in population size reduce genetic diversity and increase inbreeding, which can lead to inbreeding depression [1]. It is thus puzzling how introduced species, which typically pass through bottlenecks, become such successful invaders [2]. However, under certain theoretical conditions, bottlenecks of intermediate size can actually purge the alleles that cause inbreeding depression [3]. Although this process has been confirmed in model laboratory systems [4], it has yet to be observed in natural invasive populations. We evaluate whether such purging could facilitate biological invasions by using the world-wide invasion of the ladybird (or ladybug) Harmonia axyridis. We first show that invasive populations endured a bottleneck of intermediate intensity. We then demonstrate that replicate introduced populations experience almost none of the inbreeding depression suffered by native populations. Thus, rather than posing a barrier to invasion as often assumed, bottlenecks, by purging deleterious alleles, can enable the evolution of invaders that maintain high fitness even when inbred. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The herpetofauna of the Tuscan Islands (Central Italy) is well known and represents an ideal subject to understand the role of current and historical factors responsible for biogeographical patterns in a complex archipelago. Multidimensional Scaling, cluster analyses, species-area relationships, Mantel tests and co-occurrence statistics were used to investigate the influence of current geography and Pleistocene connections with the mainland on the structure of insular communities. Although reptile colonization likely occurred via land bridges for islands that were connected to the mainland in the Pleistocene, a long time relaxation (species extinction by island habitat loss after disconnection and new colonization by over sea dispersal or human-assisted introductions) equilibrated the faunas according to island area. Biogeographical similarities among islands increased for islands located farther from Corsica and Tuscany, thus suggesting that, for remote islands, interisland faunal exchanges occurred more frequently than mainland-island colonization. Also, a possible influence of Pleistocene geography emerged more clearly when populations suspected to be introduced by man were removed. Co-occurrence analyses indicated a nonrandom distribution influenced by island area and distance, suggesting that the time elapsed since post-Pleistocene disconnection may have reshaped biogeographical similarities by an increase in competition resulting from reduction in island areas and introduction of certain species. From a conservation viewpoint, the land-bridge distribution of organisms with poor mobility should be carefully considered in conservation biogeography, because depletion of island populations cannot be balanced by new immigrations from the mainland, whereas introduction of nonnative species may have a negative impact on the original fauna},

	abstract = {Bayesian methods have become extremely popular in molecular ecology studies because they allow us to estimate demographic parameters of complex demographic scenarios using genetic data. Articles presenting new methods generally include sensitivity studies that evaluate their performance, but they tend to be limited and need to be followed by a more thorough evaluation. Here we evaluate the performance of a recent method, bayesass, which allows the estimation of recent migration rates among populations, as well as the inbreeding coefficient of each local population. We expand the simulation study of the original publication by considering multi-allelic markers and scenarios with varying number of populations. We also investigate the effect of varying migration rates and F(ST) more thoroughly in order to identify the region of parameter space where the method is and is not able to provide accurate estimates of migration rate. Results indicate that if the demographic history of the species being studied fits the assumptions of the inference model, and if genetic differentiation is not too low (F(ST) {\textgreater} or = 0.05), then the method can give fairly accurate estimates of migration rates even when they are fairly high (about 0.1). However, when the assumptions of the inference model are violated, accurate estimates are obtained only if migration rates are very low (m = 0.01) and genetic differentiation is high (F(ST) {\textgreater} or = 0.10). Our results also show that using posterior assignment probabilities as an indication of how much confidence we can place on the assignments is problematical since the posterior probability of assignment can be very high even when the individual assignments are very inaccurate.},

In many contexts, such as educational and psychological testing, cluster analysis is a useful means for exploring datasets and identifying un- derlying groups among individuals. However, standard approaches to cluster analysis assume that the variables used to group observations are continu- ous in nature. This paper focuses on four methods for calculating distance between individuals using dichotomous data, and the subsequent introduc- tion of these distances to a clustering algorithm such as Ward's. The four methods in question, are potentially useful for practitioners because they are relatively easy to carry out using standard statistical software such as SAS and SPSS, and have been shown to have potential for correctly grouping ob- servations based on dichotomous data. Results of both a simulation study and application to a set of binary survey responses show that three of the four measures behave similarly, and can yield correct cluster recovery rates of between 60{\%} and 90{\%}. Furthermore, these methods were found to work better, in nearly all cases, than using the raw data with Ward's clustering algorithm.},

	abstract = {As the body of heterozygosity-fitness correlation (HFC) research grows, more and increasingly complicated tests have become an integral part of a typical HFC analysis (Chapman et al. 2009). Currently, no software is available to undertake conversion between the file formats required to conduct all of these tests and to conduct the main regression analyses at the core of all HFCs. Heterozygosity-Fitness Pipeline (HeFPipe) is a script written in Python that accomplishes both of these tasks for studies based on microsatellite data. HeFPipe is designed to be used from the command line terminal and will run on any Mac OSX computer. The script takes input in the form of allele reports from either the genotype-calling software, GeneMapper or GeneMarker, and reconfigures the data into GENEPOP (Raymond {\&} Rousset 1995), Rhh (Alho et al. 2010), RMES (David et al. 2007) and GEPHAST (Amos {\&} Acevedo-Whitehouse 2009) formats. The script is also equipped to reformat the output from GENEPOP on the Web (option 5) and Rhh into csv spreadsheets that can be incorporated into downstream analyses. HeFPipe accommodates user-provided lists of samples and markers to be included in or excluded from analyses. HeFPipe is equipped to create generalized linear models (GLMs) from both the main data set and subsets of the data. Finally, HeFPipe allows users to explore single-marker effects and conduct correlation analyses. The script, a comprehensive manual, a link to a series of video tutorials, and an example data set are available from GitHub (http://github.com/Atticus29/HeFPipe{\_}rpos).},

	abstract = {We used a population genetic approach to quantify major population subdivisions and patterns of migration within a broadly distributed Indo-Pacific parrotfish. We genotyped 15 microsatellite loci in Scarus rubroviolaceus collected from 20 localities between Africa and the Americas. A STRUCTURE model indicates the presence of four major populations: Eastern Pacific, Hawaii, Central-West Pacific and a less well-differentiated Indian Ocean. We used the isolation and migration model to estimate splitting times, population sizes and migration patterns between sister population pairs. To eliminate loci under selection, we used BayeScan to select loci for three isolation and migration models: Eastern Pacific and Central-West Pacific, Hawaii and the Central-West Pacific, and Indian Ocean and the Central-West Pacific. To test the assumption of a stepwise mutation model (SMM), we used likelihood to test the SMM against a two-phase model that allowed mutational complexity. A posteriori, minor departures from SMM were estimated to affect ≤2{\%} of the alleles in the data. The data were informative about the contemporary and ancestral population sizes, migration rates and the splitting time in the eastern Pacific/Central-West Pacific comparison. The model revealed a splitting time ∼17,000 BP, a larger contemporary N(e) in the Central-West Pacific than in the eastern Pacific and a strong bias of east to west migration. These characteristics support the Center of Accumulation model of peripatric diversification in low-diversity peripheral sites and perhaps migration from those sites to the western Pacific diversity hotspot.},

	abstract = {Females in a variety of species commonly mate with multiple males, and there is evidence that they benefit by producing offspring of higher genetic quality; however, the nature of these genetic benefits is debated. Enhanced offspring survival or quality can result from intrinsic effects of paternal genes---'good genes'--or from interactions between the maternal and paternal genomes--'compatible genes'. Evidence for the latter process is accumulating: matings between relatives lead to decreased reproductive success, and the individual level of inbreeding--measured as average heterozygosity--is a strong fitness predictor. Females should thus benefit from mating with genetically dissimilar males. In many birds, social monogamy restricts mate choice, but females may circumvent this by pursuing extra-pair copulations. Here we show that female blue tits, Parus caeruleus, increase the heterozygosity of their progeny through extra-pair matings. Females thereby produce offspring of higher reproductive value, because less inbred individuals have increased survival chances, a more elaborate male secondary sexual trait (crown colour) and higher reproductive success. The cost of inbreeding may therefore be an important factor driving the evolution of female extra-pair mating.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) have become one of the most widely used molecular markers to study the genetic structure of natural populations. Most of the statistical methods available to study the genetic structure of populations using AFLPs consider these markers as dominant and are thus unable to distinguish between individuals being heterozygous or homozygous for the dominant allele. Some attempts have been made to treat AFLPs as codominant markers by using AFLP band intensities to infer the most likely genotype of each individual. These two approaches have some drawbacks, the former discarding potentially valuable information and the latter being sometimes unable to correctly assign genotypes to individuals. In this study, we propose an alternative likelihood-based approach, which does not attempt at inferring the genotype of each individual, but rather incorporate the uncertainty about genotypes into a Bayesian framework leading to the estimation of population-specific F(IS) and F(ST) coefficients. We show with simulations that the accuracy of our method is much higher than one using AFLP as dominant markers and is generally close to what would be obtained by using the same number of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers. The method is applied to a data set of four populations of the common vole (Microtus arvalis) from Grisons in Switzerland, for which we obtained 562 polymorphic AFLP markers. Our approach is very general and has the potential to make AFLP markers as useful as SNP data for nonmodel species.},

	abstract = {Identifying loci under natural selection from genomic surveys is of great interest in different research areas. Commonly used methods to separate neutral effects from adaptive effects are based on locus-specific population differentiation coefficients to identify outliers. Here we extend such an approach to estimate directly the probability that each locus is subject to selection using a Bayesian method. We also extend it to allow the use of dominant markers like AFLPs. It has been shown that this model is robust to complex demographic scenarios for neutral genetic differentiation. Here we show that the inclusion of isolated populations that underwent a strong bottleneck can lead to a high rate of false positives. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that it is possible to avoid them by carefully choosing the populations that should be included in the analysis. We analyze two previously published data sets: a human data set of codominant markers and a Littorina saxatilis data set of dominant markers. We also perform a detailed sensitivity study to compare the power of the method using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), SNP, and microsatellite markers.

An unusual opportunity is afforded by three decades of individual-based data collected from a declining population of Antarctic fur seals in the SouthAtlantic. Here, climate change has reduced prey availability and caused a significant decline in seal birth weight. However, the mean age and size of females recruiting into the breeding population are increasing.We show that such females have significantly higher heterozygosity (a measure ofwithin-individual genetic variation) than their non-recruiting siblings and theirownmothers. Thus, breeding female heterozygosity has increased by 8.5{\%}per generation over the last two decades.Nonetheless, as heterozygosity is not inherited from mothers to daughters, substantial heterozygote advantage isnot transmitted fromone generation to the next and the decreasing viability of homozygous individuals causes the population to decline. Our results provide compelling evidence that selection due to climate change is intensifying, with far-reaching consequences for demography as well as phenotypic and genetic variation.},

	abstract = {Patterns of resource selection by animal populations emerge as a result of the behavior of many individuals. Statistical models that describe these population-level patterns of habitat use can miss important interactions between individual animals and characteristics of their local environment; however, identifying these interactions is difficult. One approach to this problem is to incorporate models of individual movement into resource selection models. To do this, we propose a model for step selection functions (SSF) that is composed of a resource-independent movement kernel and a resource selection function (RSF). We show that standard case-control logistic regression may be used to fit the SSF; however, the sampling scheme used to generate control points (i.e., the definition of availability) must be accommodated. We used three sampling schemes to analyze simulated movement data and found that ignoring sampling and the resource-independent movement kernel yielded biased estimates of selection. The level of bias depended on the method used to generate control locations, the strength of selection, and the spatial scale of the resource map. using empirical or parametric methods to sample control locations produced biased estimates under stronger selection; however, we show that the addition of a distance function to the analysis substantially reduced that bias. Assuming a uniform availability within a fixed buffer yielded strongly biased selection estimates that could be corrected by including the distance function but remained inefficient relative to the empirical and parametric sampling methods. As a case study, we used location data collected from elk in Yellowstone National Park, USA, to show that selection and bias may be temporally variable. Because under constant selection the amount of bias depends on the scale at which a resource is distributed in the landscape, we suggest that distance always be included as a covariate in SSF analyses. This approach to modeling resource selection is easily implemented using common statistical tools and promises to provide deeper insight into the movement ecology of animals. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

@article{Forstmeier2012,
	abstract = {Numerous studies have reported associations between heterozygosity in microsatellite markers and fitness-related traits (heterozygosity-fitness correlations, HFCs). However, it has often been questioned whether HFCs reflect general inbreeding depression, because a small panel of microsatellite markers does not reflect very well an individual's inbreeding coefficient (F) as calculated from a pedigree. Here, we challenge this prevailing view. Because of chance events during Mendelian segregation, an individual's realized proportion of the genome that is identical by descent (IBD) may substantially deviate from the pedigree-based expectation (i.e. F). This Mendelian noise may result in a weak correlation between F and multi-locus heterozygosity, but this does not imply that multi-locus heterozygosity is a bad estimator of realized IBD. We examined correlations between 11 fitness-related traits measured in up to 1192 captive zebra finches and three measures of inbreeding: (i) heterozygosity across 11 microsatellite markers, (ii) heterozygosity across 1359 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and (iii) F, based on a 5th-generation pedigree. All 11 phenotypic traits showed positive relationships with measures of heterozygosity, especially traits that are most closely related to fitness. Remarkably, the small panel of microsatellite markers produced equally strong HFCs as the large panel of SNP markers. Both marker-based approaches produced stronger correlations with phenotypes than the pedigree-based F, and this did not seem to result from the shortness of our pedigree. We argue that a small panel of microsatellites with high allelic richness may better reflect an individual's realized IBD than previously appreciated, especially in species like the zebra finch, where much of the genome is inherited in large blocks that rarely experience cross-over during meiosis.},

	abstract = {A trophic cascade recently has been reported among wolves, elk, and aspen on the northern winter range of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA, but the mechanisms of indirect interactions within this food chain have yet to be established. We investigated whether the observed trophic cascade might have a behavioral basis by exploring environmental factors influencing the movements of 13 female elk equipped with GPS radio collars. We developed a simple statistical approach that can unveil the concurrent influence of several environmental features on animal movements. Paths of elk traveling on their winter range were broken down into steps, which correspond to the straight-line segment between successive locations at 5-hour intervals. Each observed step was paired with 200 random steps having the same starting point, but differing in length and/or direction. Comparisons between the characteristics of observed and random steps using conditional logistic regression were used to model environmental features influencing movement patterns. We found that elk movements were influenced by multiple factors, such as the distance from roads, the presence of a steep slope along the step, and the cover type in which they ended. The influence of cover type on elk movements depended on the spatial distribution of wolves across the northern winter range of the park. In low wolf-use areas, the relative preference for end point locations of steps followed: aspen stands {\textgreater} open areas {\textgreater} conifer forests. As the risks of wolf encounter increased, the preference of elk for aspen stands gradually decreased, and selection became strongest for steps ending in conifer forests in high wolf-use areas. Our study clarifies the behavioral mechanisms involved in the trophic cascade of Yellowstone's wolf-elk-aspen system: elk respond to wolves on their winter range by a shift in habitat selection, which leads to local reductions in the use of aspen by elk. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

The existence of a distinct "ancestral" group should be questioned. To be classified as a new Rickettsia species, an isolate should not exhibit more than one of the following degrees of nucleotide similarity with the most homologous validated species: {\textgreater}/=99.8 and {\textgreater}/=99.9{\%} for the rrs and gltA genes, respectively, and, when amplifiable, {\textgreater}/=98.8, {\textgreater}/=99.2, and {\textgreater}/=99.3{\%} for the ompA and ompB genes and gene D, respectively.

	abstract = {Inbreeding-environment interactions occur when inbreeding leads to differential fitness loss in different environments. Inbred individuals are often more sensitive to environmental stress than are outbred individuals, presumably because stress increases the expression of deleterious recessive alleles or cellular safeguards against stress are pushed beyond the organism's physiological limits. We examined inbreeding-environment interactions, along two environmental axes (temperature and rearing host) that differ in the amount of developmental stress they impose, in the seed-feeding beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. We found that inbreeding depression (inbreeding load, L) increased with the stressfulness of the environment, with the magnitude of stress explaining as much as 66{\%} of the variation in inbreeding depression. This relationship between L and developmental stress was not explainable by an increase in phenotypic variation in more stressful environments. To examine the generality of this experimental result, we conducted a meta-analysis of the available data from published studies looking at stress and inbreeding depression. The meta-analysis confirmed that the effect of the environment on inbreeding depression scales linearly with the magnitude of stress; a population suffers one additional lethal equivalent, on average, for each 30{\%} reduction in fitness induced by the stressful environment. Studies using less-stressful environments may lack statistical power to detect the small changes in inbreeding depression. That the magnitude of inbreeding depression scales with the magnitude of the stress applied has numerous repercussions for evolutionary and conservation genetics and may invigorate research aimed at finding the causal mechanism involved in such a relationship.},

	abstract = {The degree to which, and rapidity with which, inbreeding depression can be purged from a population has important implications for conservation biology, captive breeding practices, and invasive species biology. The degree and rate of purging also informs us regarding the genetic mechanisms underlying inbreeding depression. We examine the evolution of mean survival and inbreeding depression in survival following serial inbreeding in a seed-feeding beetle, Stator limbatus, which shows substantial inbreeding depression at all stages of development. We created two replicate serially inbred populations perpetuated by full-sib matings and paired with outbred controls. The genetic load for the probability that an egg produces an adult was purged at approximately 0.45-0.50 lethal equivalents/generation, a reduction of more than half after only three generations of sib-mating. After serial inbreeding we outcrossed all beetles then measured (1) larval survival of outcrossed beetles and (2) inbreeding depression. Survival of outcrossed beetles evolved to be higher in the serially inbred populations for all periods of development. Inbreeding depression and the genetic load were significantly lower in the serially inbred than control populations. Inbreeding depression affecting larval survival of S. limbatus is largely due to recessive deleterious alleles of large effect that can be rapidly purged from a population by serial sib-mating. However, the effectiveness of purging varied among the periods of egg/larval survival and likely varies among other unstudied fitness components. This study presents novel results showing rapid and extensive purging of the genetic load, specifically a reduction of as much as 72{\%} in only three generations of sib-mating. However, the high rate of extinction of inbred lines, despite the lines being reared in a benign laboratory environment, indicates that intentional purging of the genetic load of captive endangered species will not be practical due to high rates of subpopulation extinction.},

Despite 22 variation in inbreeding depression among temperatures, inbreeding depression did not 23 increase consistently with our proxy for developmental stress. However, inbreeding 24 changed which environments are benign versus stressful for beetles; although 20?C was not 25 a stressful rearing temperature for outbred beetles, it became the most stressful environ- 26 ment for inbred larvae.

Here I review the evidence on the contribution of genetic factors to extinction risk. Inbreeding depression, loss of genetic diversity and mutation accumulation have been hypothesised to increase extinction risk. There is now compelling evidence that inbreeding depression and loss of genetic diversity increase extinction risk in laboratory populations of naturally outbreeding species. There is now clear evidence for inbreeding depression in wild species of naturally outbreeding species and strong grounds from individual case studies and from computer projections for believing that this contributes to extinction risk. Further, most species are not driven to extinction before genetic factors have time to impact. The contributions of mutation accumulation to extinction risk in threatened taxa appear to be small and to require very many generations. Thus, there is now sufficient evidence to regard the controversies regarding the contribution of genetic factors to extinction risk as resolved. If genetic factors are ignored, extinction risk will be underestimated and inappropriate recovery strategies may be used.},

	abstract = {As wild environments are often inhospitable, many species have to be captive-bred to save them from extinction. In captivity, species adapt genetically to the captive environment and these genetic adaptations are overwhelmingly deleterious when populations are returned to wild environments. I review empirical evidence on (i) the genetic basis of adaptive changes in captivity, (ii) factors affecting the extent of genetic adaptation to captivity, and (iii) means for minimizing its deleterious impacts. Genetic adaptation to captivity is primarily due to rare alleles that in the wild were deleterious and partially recessive. The extent of adaptation to captivity depends upon selection intensity, genetic diversity, effective population size and number of generation in captivity, as predicted by quantitative genetic theory. Minimizing generations in captivity provides a highly effective means for minimizing genetic adaptation to captivity, but is not a practical option for most animal species. Population fragmentation and crossing replicate captive populations provide practical means for minimizing the deleterious effects of genetic adaptation to captivity upon populations reintroduced into the wild. Surprisingly, equalization of family sizes reduces the rate of genetic adaptation, but not the deleterious impacts upon reintroduced populations. Genetic adaptation to captivity is expected to have major effects on reintroduction success for species that have spent many generations in captivity. This issue deserves a much higher priority than it is currently receiving.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Fragmentation of animal and plant populations typically leads to genetic erosion and increased probability of extirpation. Although these effects can usually be reversed by re-establishing gene flow between population fragments, managers sometimes fail to do so due to fears of outbreeding depression (OD). Rapid development of OD is due primarily to adaptive differentiation from selection or fixation of chromosomal variants. Fixed chromosomal variants can be detected empirically. We used an extended form of the breeders' equation to predict the probability of OD due to adaptive differentiation between recently isolated population fragments as a function of intensity of selection, genetic diversity, effective population sizes, and generations of isolation. Empirical data indicated that populations in similar environments had not developed OD even after thousands of generations of isolation. To predict the probability of OD, we developed a decision tree that was based on the four variables from the breeders' equation, taxonomic status, and gene flow within the last 500 years. The predicted probability of OD in crosses between two populations is elevated when the populations have at least one of the following characteristics: are distinct species, have fixed chromosomal differences, exchanged no genes in the last 500 years, or inhabit different environments. Conversely, the predicted probability of OD in crosses between two populations of the same species is low for populations with the same karyotype, isolated for {\textless}500 years, and that occupy similar environments. In the former case, we recommend crossing be avoided or tried on a limited, experimental basis. In the latter case, crossing can be carried out with low probability of OD. We used crosses with known results to test the decision tree and found that it correctly identified cases where OD occurred. Current concerns about OD in recently fragmented populations are almost certainly excessive.},

However, experimental evaluations of the effects of bottlenecks on quantitative genetic variation do not always follow predictions, especially for characters related to reproductive fitness. Populations of Drosophila melanogaster were subjected to population bottlenecks of a single pair for one or three generations, and their ability to tolerate increasing concentrations of NaCl was compared with those of their outbred base populations, and related highly inbred lines. Bottlenecked populations became extinct at significantly lower concentrations of NaCl than their non-bottlenecked base populations.

	abstract = {The role of genetic factors in extinction has been a controversial issue, especially since Lande's paper [Genetics and demography in biological conservation, Science 241 (1988) 1455-1460] paper in Science. Here I review the evidence on the contribution of genetic factors to extinction risk. Inbreeding depression, loss of genetic diversity and mutation accumulation have been hypothesised to increase extinction risk. There is now compelling evidence that inbreeding depression and loss of genetic diversity increase extinction risk in laboratory populations of naturally outbreeding species. There is now clear evidence for inbreeding depression in wild species of naturally outbreeding species and strong grounds from individual case studies and from computer projections for believing that this contributes to extinction risk. Further, most species are not driven to extinction before genetic factors have time to impact. The contributions of mutation accumulation to extinction risk in threatened taxa appear to be small and to require very many generations. Thus, there is now sufficient evidence to regard the controversies regarding the contribution of genetic factors to extinction risk as resolved. If genetic factors are ignored, extinction risk will be underestimated and inappropriate recovery strategies may be used. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Inbreeding depression is one possible explanation for this. Insular populations are expected to suffer increased inbreeding relative to mainland populations due to bottlenecks at foundation and to lower subsequent population sizes. Inbreeding coefficients for 182 nonendemic and 28 endemic island populations were estimated from allozyme and microsatellite heterozygosities in island and related mainland populations. Island populations were significantly inbred, with inbreeding coefficients significantly higher in endemic than nonendemic island populations. Many island populations showed levels of inbreeding associated with elevated extinction rates in domestic and laboratory species. Inbreeding depression cannot be excluded as a factor in the extinction proneness of island populations.},

However, there is controversy over the effective population size (N-e) required for endangered species to retain their evolutionary potential, with proposed sizes ranging from 500 to 5000. The highest estimate is based on the assumption that 90{\%} of mutations are deleterious. We review that arguments for an effective size of 5000 and conclude that it assumes effective mutation rates that are too low, and heritabilities that are, in general, very high. We conclude that an N-e of 500-1000 is appropriate at this time.},

@article{Fraser2001,
	abstract = {Recent years have seen a debate over various methods that could objectively prioritize conservation value below the species level. Most prominent among these has been the evolutionarily significant unit (ESU). We reviewed ESU concepts with the aim of proposing a more unified concept that would reconcile opposing views. Like species concepts, conflicting ESU concepts are all essentially aiming to define the same thing: segments of species whose divergence can be measured or evaluated by putting differential emphasis on the role of evolutionary forces at varied temporal scales. Thus, differences between ESU concepts lie more in the criteria used to define the ESUs themselves rather than in their fundamental essence. We provide a context-based framework for delineating ESUs which circumvents much of this situation. Rather than embroil in a befuddled debate over an optimal criterion, the key to a solution is accepting that differing criteria will work more dynamically than others and can be used alone or in combination depending on the situation. These assertions constitute the impetus behind adaptive evolutionary conservation.},

The map is estimated to capture untyped common variation with an average maximum r2 of between 0.9 and 0.96 depending on population. We demonstrate that the current generation of commercial genome-wide genotyping products captures common Phase II SNPs with an average maximum r2 of up to 0.8 in African and up to 0.95 in non-African populations, and that potential gains in power in association studies can be obtained through imputation. These data also reveal novel aspects of the structure of linkage disequilibrium. We show that 10-30{\%} of pairs of individuals within a population share at least one region of extended genetic identity arising from recent ancestry and that up to 1{\%} of all common variants are untaggable, primarily because they lie within recombination hotspots. We show that recombination rates vary systematically around genes and between genes of different function. Finally, we demonstrate increased differentiation at non-synonymous, compared to synonymous, SNPs, resulting from systematic differences in the strength or efficacy of natural selection between populations.},

	abstract = {Although inbreeding can reduce individual fitness and contribute to population extinction, gene flow between inbred but unrelated populations may overcome these effects. Among extant Mexican wolves (Canis lupus baileyi), inbreeding had reduced genetic diversity and potentially lowered fitness, and as a result, three unrelated captive wolf lineages were merged beginning in 1995. We examined the effect of inbreeding and the merging of the founding lineages on three fitness traits in the captive population and on litter size in the reintroduced population. We found little evidence of inbreeding depression among captive wolves of the founding lineages, but large fitness increases, genetic rescue, for all traits examined among F1 offspring of the founding lineages. In addition, we observed strong inbreeding depression among wolves descended from F1 wolves. These results suggest a high load of deleterious alleles in the McBride lineage, the largest of the founding lineages. In the wild, reintroduced population, there were large fitness differences between McBride wolves and wolves with ancestry from two or more lineages, again indicating a genetic rescue. The low litter and pack sizes observed in the wild population are consistent with this genetic load, but it appears that there is still potential to establish vigorous wild populations.},

	abstract = {Human population and thus anthropogenic disturbance of natural systems are increasing at staggering rates. However, the impact of disturbance on natural systems likely varies with the extent of disturbance. While a considerable amount of research has been conducted on high-impact disturbances (e.g., environmental contamination, urban development), much less is known about the effects of less obtrusive activities such as ecotourism and outdoor recreation. Past research has documented behavioral and hormonal changes to non-consumptive wildlife activities; however, these studies rarely provide direct health and survival consequences, or examine impacts over a gradient of disturbances. In the current study, we quantified endocrine and immune responses and reproductive investment in six Gal{\'{a}}pagos marine iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) populations located across a gradient of human disturbance stemming from the ecotourism industry, including urban development, boat traffic, and ecotourist activities. We regressed fitness-related physiological metrics to the intensity of human disturbance across these populations. As predicted, immunological capabilities decreased and oxidative stress increased with increasing intensity of human disturbance and development. Sexes also differed in their endocrine responses to disturbance intensity, with only males showing elevated baseline corticosterone at sites impacted by tourism. Testosterone and estradiol were both positively related to disturbance intensity. There was also a significant overall negative effect of the presence of human disturbance, but not its intensity, on reproductive investment.

	abstract = {The Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery plan proposed reintroduction of Canis lupus (gray wolf) to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho as part of a wolf restoration plan for the northern Rocky Mountains of the United States. Strong opposition from some factions within the region forestalled the action for two decades. An environmental impact statement, conducted in 1992-1994 with extensive public input, culminated in a proposal to reintroduce wolves designated as "non-essential-experimental" under Section 10 (j) of the federal Endangered Species Act. This approach, approved by the Secretary of the Interior in 1994, provided for wolf restoration while allowing management flexibility to deal with concerns of the local public. A reintroduction plan was developed in the summer and fall of 1994. Acquiring, holding, transporting, and releasing suitable wolves for reintroduction presented a myriad of technical and logistical challenges that required effective planning and coordination by all participants. In January 1995, 29 wolves were captured in Alberta and transported to Yellowstone National Park (14) and central Idaho (15). Idaho wolves were freed immediately upon arrival; Yellowstone wolves (three family groups) were held in acclimation pens in the park until late March. Most Idaho wolves traveled extensively within the area intended for them, averaging 82 km net distance away from release sites after 5 months (range = 30-220 km), and three male-female pairs formed by July. After 5 months in the wild, at least 13 of 15 Idaho-released wolves were alive within the intended area, as were 13 of 14 Yellowstone wolves; one wolf was known to have been illegally killed in each area. No livestock were killed. Wolves released into Yellowstone Park continued to live as packs, stayed closer to their release sites ( hivin x = 22 km at end of June), and settled into home ranges; two packs produced a total of nine pups.},

Another purpose is to study the powers of existing and newly developed tests and to examine the detailed pattern of polymorphisms under population growth, genetic hitchhiking and background selection. It is found that the polymorphic patterns in a DNA sample under logistic population growth and genetic hitchhiking are very similar and that one of the newly developed tests, Fs, is considerably more powerful than existing tests for rejecting the hypothesis of neutrality of mutations. Background selection gives rise to quite different polymorphic patterns than does logistic population growth or genetic hitchhiking, although all of them show excesses of rare alleles or young mutations. We show that Fu and Li's tests are among the most powerful tests against background selection. Implications of these results are discussed.},

However, in well-sampled gene trees, certain alleles in one species may appear more closely related to alleles from different species than to other conspecific alleles. Such deviations from species-level monophyly have a variety of causes and may lead to erroneous evolutionary interpretations if unde- tected. The present paper describes the causes and consequences of these paraphyletic and polyphyletic patterns. It also provides a detailed literature survey of mitochondrial DNA studies on low-level animal phylogeny and phylogeography, results from which reveal the frequency of nonmonophyly and patterns of interpretation and sampling. This survey detected species-level paraphyly or polyphyly in 23{\%} of 2319 assayed species, demonstrating this phenomenon to be statistically supported, taxonomically widespread, and far more common than generally recognized. Our findings call for increased attention to sampling and the interpretation of paraphyletic and polyphyletic gene trees in studies of closely related taxa by systematists and population geneticists alike and thus for a new tradition of ``congeneric phylogeography.''},

In contrast to previous recommendations, we propose that the use of neutral versus adaptive markers should not be viewed as alternatives. Rather, neutral and adaptive markers provide different types of information that should be combined to make optimal management decisions. Genetic patterns at neutral markers reflect the interaction of gene flow and genetic drift that affects genome-wide variation within and among populations. This population genetic structure is what natural selection operates on to cause adaptive divergence. Here, we provide a new framework to integrate data on neutral and adaptive markers to protect biodiversity. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The introduction of alien species to islands by human activity can cause catastrophic consequences for small populations of island endemics. Hybridization between the endangered and endemic insular lizard Podarcis atrata (Bosc{\'{a}}, 1916) from the Columbretes Islands (Mediterranean, Spain) and the common mainland lizard Podarcis hispanica (Steindachner, 1870) could potentially occur because mainland haplotypes have already been detected in the islands, the two species are closely genetically related, and the frequency of visitors to these islands is increasing. However, reproductive decisions of lizards are often mediated by species recognition mechanisms based on chemical cues. On the basis of this observation, even if some mainland P. hispanica lizards were introduced to the islands, interspecific recognition might make rare an eventual hybridization with the insular P. atrata. We examined interspecific chemical recognition between the insular P. atrata and the mainland P. hispanica. Our results showed that lizards of both sexes responded more strongly (i.e., directed a significantly higher number of tongue flicks) to scents of conspecific individuals than to scents of heterospecifics. Chemical recognition of conspecifics by endemic island P. atrata lizards may reduce the occurrence of hybridization with introduced mainland P. hispanica lizards and protect the insular gene pool.},

	abstract = {Chemical signals can be the basis of interspecific recognition and speciation in many animals. The Columbretes Islands wall lizard, Podarcis atrata is very close genetically to the mainland Iberian wall lizard Podarcis hispanica. However, a previous study suggested that chemosensory interspecific recognition would avoid reproductive interactions and hybridization between these two species. These results suggested that chemicals used in intraspecific communication might differ in composition and/or proportions between these two species. In this paper, we used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to characterize the chemical composition of the lipophilic fraction from femoral gland secretions of male P. atrata and P. hispanica. The analysis showed that chemicals found in femoral secretions varied in composition and proportions between species and between populations. Seven steroids and two unidentified waxy esters, were exclusive of P. atrata lizards from the islands. In contrast, nine steroids and other six compounds were only found in mainland P. hispanica. There were also differences in proportions of shared compounds between species. Moreover, all these differences were higher between P. atrata and P. hispanica than between any population of P. hispanica. Chemical differences might be consequence of genetic differences, but they could also be explained by adaptation to different habitats with different climatic conditions or diet resources. Compounds that are specific of each species, or differences in the pattern of compounds, could explain species recognition. Therefore, these results of chemical composition and previous studies of chemosensory recognition reinforce the fact that the genetic differences between P. hispanica and P. atrata may result in an effective reproductive isolation between these two taxa. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

We explored the role of chemical sexual signals in interpopulational recognition between five distinct populations of Iberian wall lizards in Central Spain. Results showed that these populations differed in morphology and in composition and proportion of chemical compounds in femoral gland secretions of males. Tongue-flick experiments indicated that male and female lizards discriminated and were more interested in scents of lizards from their own area (i.e., Northern versus Southern populations), but did not discriminate between all populations. Moreover, only males from the populations that are geographically located more far away preferred scent of females from their own population. These data suggest that, at least between some populations, there may be reproductive isolation mediated by chemical signals and cryptic speciation.},

This has been especially well studied in European and North American snake species. In contrast, there is a general lack of knowledge on the biology and especially on the use of chemical signals by most Neotropical snake species. Here, we explored the existence of intraspecific recognition by chemical cues in several snake species from Ecuador within the families Boidae (Boa constrictor constrictor, Boa constrictor imperator, Corallus hortulanus, and Epicrates cenchria) and Colubridae (Lampropeltis triangulum micropholis) by using experiments of tongue-flicking discrimination. Results showed that individuals of all species tested showed higher chemosensory responses to odors from conspecific individuals when compared to odors from individuals of other species, suggesting intraspecific chemosensory recognition in these snake species. In contrast, there was not chemosensory recognition between the two subspecies of B. constrictor. We show that some Neotropical snake species are able to use chemical cues of conspecifics in intraspecific recognition, but further studies are needed to analyze the role of chemical signals in their biology and social behavior.},

The factors controlling the switch between the 2 types of reproduction are unknown. Studies on A. franciscana from the Great Salt Lake of Utah, USA, show the percentage of zygotes produced as cysts is correlated with the level of heterozygosity (determined electrophoretically) in the mother. More heterozygous females also produce more zygotes, and tend to produce more broods and start to reproduce at a younger age than less heterozygous females. Coefficients of variation of reproductive characters are lower for more heterozygous and higher for less heterozygous mothers. These results show that heterozygosity in this species is highly correlated with important components of fitness and suggest that the ability to switch reproductive mode, a feature of considerable adaptive value in varying environments, and of importance in aquaculture, has a high degree of genetic determination.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mutation rate (mu) per generation per locus is an important parameter in the models of population genetics. Studies on mutation rate and its variation are of significance to elucidate the extent and distribution of genetic variation, further infer evolutionary relationships among closely related species, and deeply understand genetic variation of genomes. However, patterns of rate variation of microsatellite loci are still poorly understood in plant species. Furthermore, how their mutation rates vary in di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide repeats within the species is largely uninvestigated across related plant genomes. RESULTS: Genome-wide variation of mutation rates was first investigated by means of the composite population parameter theta (theta = 4Nmu, where N is the effective population size and mu is the mutation rate per locus per generation) in four subspecies of Asian cultivated rice O. sativa and its three related species, O. rufipogon, O. glaberrima, and O. officinalis. On the basis of three data sets of microsatellite allele frequencies throughout the genome, population mutation rate (theta) was estimated for each locus. Our results reveal that the variation of population mutation rates at microsatellites within each studied species or subspecies of cultivated rice can be approximated with a gamma distribution. The mean population mutation rates of microsatellites do not significantly differ in motifs of di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide repeats for the studied rice species. The shape parameter was also estimated for each subspecies of rice as well as other related rice species. Of them, different subspecies of O. sativa possesses similar shape parameters (alpha) of the gamma distribution, while other species extensively vary in their population mutation rates. CONCLUSION: Through the analysis of genome-wide microsatellite data, the population mutation rate can be approximately fitted with a gamma distribution in most of the studied species. In general, different population histories occurred along different lineages may result in the observed variation of population mutation rates at microsatellites among the studied Oryza species.},

	abstract = {It has been widely appreciated that natural selection opposes the progress of inbreeding in small populations, thus limiting the actual inbreeding depression for fitness traits. However, no method to account for the consequences of this process has been given so far. I give a simple and intuitive method to predict inbreeding depression, taking into account the increase in selection efficiency against recessive alleles during inbreeding. It is based on the use of a "purged inbreeding coefficient" g(t) that accounts for the reduction of the probability of the deleterious homozygotes caused by the excess d of detrimental effect for deleterious alleles in the homozygous condition over its additive expectation. It is shown that the effect of purging can be important even for relatively small populations. For between-loci variable deleterious effects, accurate predictions can be obtained using the effective homozygous deleterious excess d(e), which can be estimated experimentally and is robust against variation of the ancestral effective population size. The method can be extended to any trait and it is used to predict the evolution of the mean viability or fecundity in a conservation program with equal or random family contributions.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Chemical communication plays a central role in social, sexual and ecological interactions among animals. However, the macroevolutionary diversification of traits responsible for chemical signaling remains fundamentally unknown. Most research investigating evolutionary diversification of glands responsible for the production of chemical signals has focused on arthropods, while its study among vertebrates remains neglected. Using a global-scale dataset covering {\textgreater} 80{\%} (7,904 species) of the living diversity of lizards and snakes (squamates), we investigate rates, trajectories and phylogenetic patterns of diversification of their follicular glands for chemical communication. We observed these glands in 13.66{\%} of species, that their expression has varying phylogenetic signal among lineages, and that the crown squamate ancestor lacked follicular glands, which therefore originated and diversified subsequently during their evolutionary history. Additionally, our findings challenge the longstanding view that within squamates the Iguania are visually oriented while Scleroglossa are chemically-oriented, given that Iguania doubles Scleroglossa in the frequency of glands. Our phylogenetic analyses identified stabilizing selection as the best model describing follicular gland diversification, and revealed high rates of disparity. We provide the first global-scale analysis investigating the diversification of one of the main forms of communication among reptiles, presenting a macroevolutionary angle to questions traditionally explored at microevolutionary scale.},

	abstract = {Knowledge about chemical communication in some vertebrates is still relatively limited. Squamates are a glaring example of this, even when recent evidences indicate that scents are involved in social and sexual interactions. In lizards, where our understanding of chemical communication has considerably progressed in the last few years, many questions about chemical interactions remain unanswered. A potential reason for this is the inherent complexity and technical limitations that some methodologies embody when analyzing the compounds used to convey information. We provide here a straightforward procedure to analyze lizard chemical secretions based on gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry that uses an internal standard for the semiquantification of compounds. We compare the results of this method with those obtained by the traditional procedure of calculating relative proportions of compounds. For such purpose, we designed two experiments to investigate if these procedures allowed revealing changes in chemical secretions 1) when lizards received previously a vitamin dietary supplementation or 2) when the chemical secretions were exposed to high temperatures. Our results show that the procedure based on relative proportions is useful to describe the overall chemical profile, or changes in it, at population or species levels. On the other hand, the use of the procedure based on semiquantitative determination can be applied when the target of study is the variation in one or more particular compounds of the sample, as it has proved more accurate detecting quantitative variations in the secretions. This method would reveal new aspects produced by, for example, the effects of different physiological and climatic factors that the traditional method does not show. We provide a straightforward procedure to analyze lizard chemical secretions based on gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry that uses an internal standard for the semiquantification of compounds.},

Here, we capture lineage fusion in action in a Gal{\'{a}}pagos giant tortoise species, Chelonoidis becki, from Wolf Volcano (Isabela Island). The long generation time of Gal{\'{a}}pagos tortoises and dense sampling (841 individuals) of genetic and demographic data were integral in detecting and characterizing this phenomenon. In C. becki, we identified two genetically distinct, morphologically cryptic lineages. Historical reconstructions show that they colonized Wolf Volcano from Santiago Island in two temporally separated events, the first estimated to have occurred {\~{}}199 000 years ago. Following arrival of the second wave of colonists, both lineages coexisted for approximately {\~{}}53 000 years. Within that time, they began fusing back together, as microsatellite data reveal widespread introgressive hybridization. Interestingly, greater mate selectivity seems to be exhibited by purebred females of one of the lineages. Forward-in-time simulations predict rapid extinction of the early arriving lineage. This study provides a rare example of reticulate evolution in action and underscores the power of population genetics for understanding the past, present and future consequences of evolutionary phenomena associated with lineage fusion.},

@article{Garrick2010,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A widely-used approach for screening nuclear DNA markers is to obtain sequence data and use bioinformatic algorithms to estimate which two alleles are present in heterozygous individuals. It is common practice to omit unresolved genotypes from downstream analyses, but the implications of this have not been investigated. We evaluated the haplotype reconstruction method implemented by PHASE in the context of phylogeographic applications. Empirical sequence datasets from five non-coding nuclear loci with gametic phase ascribed by molecular approaches were coupled with simulated datasets to investigate three key issues: (1) haplotype reconstruction error rates and the nature of inference errors, (2) dataset features and genotypic configurations that drive haplotype reconstruction uncertainty, and (3) impacts of omitting unresolved genotypes on levels of observed phylogenetic diversity and the accuracy of downstream phylogeographic analyses. RESULTS: We found that PHASE usually had very low false-positives (i.e., a low rate of confidently inferring haplotype pairs that were incorrect). The majority of genotypes that could not be resolved with high confidence included an allele occurring only once in a dataset, and genotypic configurations involving two low-frequency alleles were disproportionately represented in the pool of unresolved genotypes. The standard practice of omitting unresolved genotypes from downstream analyses can lead to considerable reductions in overall phylogenetic diversity that is skewed towards the loss of alleles with larger-than-average pairwise sequence divergences, and in turn, this causes systematic bias in estimates of important population genetic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of experimental and computational approaches for resolving phase of segregating sites in phylogeographic applications is essential. We outline practical approaches to mitigating potential impacts of computational haplotype reconstruction on phylogeographic inferences. With targeted application of laboratory procedures that enable unambiguous phase determination via physical isolation of alleles from diploid PCR products, relatively little investment of time and effort is needed to overcome the observed biases.},

	abstract = {The population structure of domesticated species is influenced by the natural history of the populations of predomesticated ancestors, as well as by the breeding system and complexity of the breeding practices exercised by humans. Within Oryza sativa, there is an ancient and well-established divergence between the two major subspecies, indica and japonica, but finer levels of genetic structure are suggested by the breeding history. In this study, a sample of 234 accessions of rice was genotyped at 169 nuclear SSRs and two chloroplast loci. The data were analyzed to resolve the genetic structure and to interpret the evolutionary relationships between groups. Five distinct groups were detected, corresponding to indica, aus, aromatic, temperate japonica, and tropical japonica rices. Nuclear and chloroplast data support a closer evolutionary relationship between the indica and the aus and among the tropical japonica, temperate japonica, and aromatic groups. Group differences can be explained through contrasting demographic histories. With the availability of rice genome sequence, coupled with a large collection of publicly available genetic resources, it is of interest to develop a population-based framework for the molecular analysis of diversity in O. sativa.

	abstract = {The relationship between individual energy budgets and genetic variability was examined in T. haemastoma acclimated to 7.5, 20 and 35.permill. S (parts per thousand salinity) at 21 C. Energy budgets were determined by measuring rates of ingestion, absorption efficiencies, O2 consumption and ammonia and primary amine excretion. Genotypes at 6 polymorphic loci coding for soluble enzymes were determined using starch gel electrophoresis. There was a significant positive relationship between total heterozygosity and snail scope for growth at all 3 salinities. The relationship was due in part to the greater size of the more heterozygous individuals, since scope for growth increases with size. Analysis of covariance also revealed a significant positive effect of total heterozygosity on weight-corrected scope for growth. The increased scope for growth measured in heterozygotes was caused by significantly greater feeding rates. Heterozygous individuals at 20 and 35.permill. S had lower routine metabolic maintenance costs, expressed as energy lost per unit weight, than more highly homozygous ones. Greater metabolic efficiency did not account for much of the differences in scope for growth between heterozygotes and homozygotes, because variation in metabolic efficiency was small compared with variation in feeding rate. These results provided physiological evidence of the superiority of heterozygotes over homozygotes for growth, survival and potential reproductive output. The number of heterozygous loci per snail explains 16{\%} of the variance of whole animal energy budgets at 7.5.permill. S, 14{\%} at 20.permill. S and 15{\%} at 35.permill. S.},

	abstract = {Network analyses of mutualistic or antagonistic interactions between species are very popular, but their biological interpretations are often unclear and incautious. Here I propose to distinguish two possible implications of network patterns in conjunction with solutions to avoid misinterpretations. Interpretations can be either(1)niche-based, describing specialisation, trait (mis-)matching between species, niche breadth and niche overlap and their relationship to interspecific competition and species coexistence, or(2)impact-based, focusing on frequencies of interactions between species such as predation or infection rates and mutualistic services, aiming to quantify each species' relative contribution to an ecological effect. For niche-based implications, it is crucial to acknowledge the sampling limitations of a network and thus control for the number of observations of each species. This is particularly important for those kinds of networks that summarise observed interactions in communities (e.g. bipartite host-parasitoid or plant-animal networks), rather than compile information from different sources or experiments (as in many food webs). Variation in total observation frequencies may alone explain network patterns that have often been interpreted as 'specialisation asymmetries' (nestedness, dependence asymmetries). I show analytically that 'dependence asymmetries' between two species (or two guilds) only reflect variation in their total observation frequencies. To depict true asymmetries in niche breadth, independent data are required for both species. Moreover, simulated co-extinction scenarios assume that each species 'depends' on its associated partners in the network (again niche-based), but species that appear most endangered are simply those with one or very few observations and are not necessarily specialised. Distinguishing niche-based and impact-based interpretations may help to bridge terminological and conceptual gaps between network pattern analyses and traditional community ecology. {\textcopyright} 2010 Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r {\"{O}}kologie.},

Source heterogeneties, differing degrees of melting, or open-system magma chambers may explain the observed trace element variations. Santa Fe, Baltra, and Espa{\~{n}}ola make up a geologic subprovince in the central Galapagos: they are older than the other islands, and their lavas are compositionally similar. At the time of their emergence, the three islands were in a tectonic setting similar to that of the young western and central Galapagos Island. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

	abstract = {The paleogeography of the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Archipelago is examined in light of a modern understanding of regional geology, eustatic sea level changes, and volcano subsidence. Newly determined ages and bathymetric data are used to assess the present biogeography and the Neogene paleogeography of the archipelago. The ages of emergence of the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Islands are consistent with the Nazca Plate moving 59km/My to the east. Island age is found to be an important correlate of the number of native and unique endemic species on the islands, explaining additional variation beyond island size, which is the most important control. The age effect is most important shortly after emergence of an island. The islands' elevations are proportional to the square root of their age, leading them to sink below sea level. Holocene sea-level rise of 125m over the past 20,000years has led to the drowning of many islets and several major islands, and the fragmentation of larger islands into the currently isolated smaller islands. Thus, the geographic template for studies of organismal colonization and dispersal within the archipelago has changed drastically over recent geologic time. The integrated area of the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Islands was much greater during the Pleistocene than today, and although many more islets existed, some of the major islands were connected. Island fragmentation has led to diversification by vicariance as well as dispersal. Over the past five million years, at least seven major islands have existed within the archipelago, and the cumulative area of the islands has been at least 50{\%} of that today.},

	abstract = {Four species of iguanas occur in Gal{\'{a}}pagos. All of them are included in the red list of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and are protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. In Ecuador, attempting to remove wildlife from the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Islands is a serious environmental crime, punishable under Articles of the Ecuadorian Criminal Code. On July 2012, a tourist was arrested in Gal{\'{a}}pagos while trying to illegally transport four iguanas out of the province. The four iguanas, confiscated by the authorities of Gal{\'{a}}pagos National Park, needed rapid taxonomic identification and determination of geographic origin for the purposes of repatriation. The phylogenetic analysis of the Cytochrome b sequence data contributed to the unequivocal molecular taxonomic identification of the four confiscated iguanas, each of which belonged to the species Conolophus subcristatus. The genetic data unambiguously indicated that the four confiscated iguanas had been subtracted from the same population, currently distributed in Baltra and Seymour Norte. The use of molecular tools proved crucial for the rapid assessment of the population of origin. Such a rapid assessment was possible because a large genetic database was already available for Gal{\'{a}}pagos iguanas. It is recommended that genetic programs be developed for the complete genetic characterization of wildlife in Gal{\'{a}}pagos as well as in other areas of endemism worldwide.},

	abstract = {Despite the attention given to them, the Gal{\'{a}}pagos have not yet finished offering evolutionary novelties. When Darwin visited the Gal{\'{a}}pagos, he observed both marine (Amblyrhynchus) and land (Conolophus) iguanas but did not encounter a rare pink black-striped land iguana (herein referred to as "rosada," meaning "pink" in Spanish), which, surprisingly, remained unseen until 1986. Here, we show that substantial genetic isolation exists between the rosada and syntopic yellow forms and that the rosada is basal to extant taxonomically recognized Gal{\'{a}}pagos land iguanas. The rosada, whose present distribution is a conundrum, is a relict lineage whose origin dates back to a period when at least some of the present-day islands had not yet formed. So far, this species is the only evidence of ancient diversification along the Gal{\'{a}}pagos land iguana lineage and documents one of the oldest events of divergence ever recorded in the Gal{\'{a}}pagos. Conservation efforts are needed to prevent this form, identified by us as a good species, from extinction.},

	abstract = {In January 2002, 158 adult Turks and Caicos iguanas were translocated from islands where they are threatened to islands without existing iguana populations. To study the stress of translocation on the iguanas, we measured the body mass and baseline blood chemistry, hematology, and corticosterone of iguanas at the time of translocation and then re-sampled translocated (experimental) and source (control) populations at one, five, and 12 mo post-translocation. Most of the animals that were moved decreased in mass 1 mo after translocation but subsequently rebounded and exhibited increased growth rates at five and 12 mo post-translocation. None of the eighteen blood chemistry parameters monitored exhibited a significant change as a result of translocation at 1, 5, or 12 mo. For standard CBCs, the number of azurophils seen increased significantly after translocation and remained elevated throughout the study period, whereas all other measures did not change significantly. Corticosterone levels of experimental animals were highest 1 mo after translocation and subsequently decreased but remained significantly higher than controls throughout the study period. Despite this, successful reproduction occurred on all translocation islands during the study period. Our studies indicate that translocation can cause measurable and protracted stress on Turks and Caicos iguanas but also suggest that this stress does not significantly impede growth or reproduction.},

	abstract = {Endangered species often occur in small populations that may have a greater risk of short-term extinction due to the negative effects of inbreeding depression. The eastern massasauga (Sistrurus c. catenatus) is an endangered rattlesnake that is found in isolated populations of varying size throughout its range. Here, we investigate whether variation in an indirect measure of individual fitness (relative body condition) can be explained by genome-wide levels of genetic variation (based on 19 microsatellite loci) and other factors. To do this, we use genetic and phenotypic data from individual snakes sampled from 14 populations throughout the species' range. We tested for levels of inbreeding by comparing observed mean multi-locus heterozygosity (MLH) for each population (an estimate of average inbreeding) with the expected distribution under random mating. We then looked for evidence of heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFCs) using a measures of individual MLH and relative body condition. In all but one population, observed MLH values are indistinguishable from those generated under a model of random mating implying low levels of inbreeding in most populations. There was significant variation in both mean MLH and mean body condition within and among populations but evidence for inbreeding depression was equivocal: in support, there were some high (but largely non-significant) HFCs effect sizes within a number populations, including one that showed significant evidence for both inbreeding and a HFC. Overall, however, there was no significant correlation between MLH and body condition across all populations after controlling for non-genetic factors such as sex, season of capture and year of capture. Our results suggest that among-population and individual differences in fitness (measured as body condition) in these snakes are better explained by short-term ecological factors rather than genetic mechanisms, but leave open the possibility that limited undetected effects of inbreeding depression are present.},

	abstract = {A previous phylogeographic study of mitochondrial haplotypes for the Hispaniolan lizard Ameiva chrysolaema revealed deep genetic structure associated with seawater inundation during the late Pliocene/early Pleistocene and evidence of subsequent population expansion into formerly inundated areas. We revisit hypotheses generated by our previous study using increased geographic sampling of populations and analysis of three nuclear markers ($\alpha$-enolase intron 8, $\alpha$-cardiac-actin intron 4, and $\beta$-actin intron 3) in addition to mitochondrial haplotypes (ND2). Large genetic discontinuities correspond spatially and temporally with historical barriers to gene flow (sea inundations). NCPA cross-validation analysis and Bayesian multilocus analyses of divergence times (IMa and MCMCcoal) reveal two separate episodes of fragmentation associated with Pliocene and Pleistocene sea inundations, separating the species into historically separate Northern, East-Central, West-Central, and Southern population lineages. Multilocus Bayesian analysis using IMa indicates asymmetrical migration from the East-Central to the West-Central populations following secondary contact, consistent with expectations from the more pervasive sea inundation in the western region. The West-Central lineage has a genetic signature of population growth consistent with the expectation of geographic expansion into formerly inundated areas. Within each lineage, significant spatial genetic structure indicates isolation by distance at comparable temporal scales. This study adds to the growing body of evidence that vicariant speciation may be the prevailing source of lineage accumulation on oceanic islands. Thus, prior theories of island biogeography generally underestimate the role and temporal scale of intra-island vicariant processes. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Ameiva chrysolaema is distributed across the island of Hispaniola in the West Indies. The species is restricted to dry lowlands between major mountain ranges and along the southern and eastern coasts. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses of mtDNA sequence variation from 14 sampling localities identify at least three independent evolutionary lineages, separated from one another by major mountain ranges. Nested clade phylogeographic analysis (NCPA) suggests a complex history of population fragmentation, consistent with geological evidence of seawater incursions into the Azua and Enriquillo basins during the Pliocene/Pleistocene (∼1.6mya). Significantly negative Fu's FSvalues and parameters of mismatch distributions suggest that formerly fragmented populations have recently expanded their ranges. Significantly large average population clade distances (APCD) for two sampling localities in the Azua basin suggest secondary contact at these localities of previously separated populations. The distribution of haplotypes among polymorphic populations of A. chrysolaema suggests that variation in dorsal pattern represents a polymorphism within evolutionary lineages. Ameiva leberi is ecologically indistinguishable from and syntopic with A. chrysolaema. Genetic data suggest that A. leberi is a junior synonym of A. chrysolaema. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Does the combination of these statistical procedures and current standards of data archiving and method reporting permit the reproduction of the authors' results? To test this, we reanalysed data sets gathered from papers using the software package STRUCTURE to identify genetically similar clusters of individuals. We find that reproducing structure results can be difficult despite the straightforward requirements of the program.

@article{Gillespie2008,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Completed genome sequences are rapidly increasing for Rickettsia, obligate intracellular alpha-proteobacteria responsible for various human diseases, including epidemic typhus and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In light of phylogeny, the establishment of orthologous groups (OGs) of open reading frames (ORFs) will distinguish the core rickettsial genes and other group specific genes (class 1 OGs or C1OGs) from those distributed indiscriminately throughout the rickettsial tree (class 2 OG or C2OGs). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We present 1823 representative (no gene duplications) and 259 non-representative (at least one gene duplication) rickettsial OGs. While the highly reductive (approximately 1.2 MB) Rickettsia genomes range in predicted ORFs from 872 to 1512, a core of 752 OGs was identified, depicting the essential Rickettsia genes. Unsurprisingly, this core lacks many metabolic genes, reflecting the dependence on host resources for growth and survival. Additionally, we bolster our recent reclassification of Rickettsia by identifying OGs that define the AG (ancestral group), TG (typhus group), TRG (transitional group), and SFG (spotted fever group) rickettsiae. OGs for insect-associated species, tick-associated species and species that harbor plasmids were also predicted. Through superimposition of all OGs over robust phylogeny estimation, we discern between C1OGs and C2OGs, the latter depicting genes either decaying from the conserved C1OGs or acquired laterally. Finally, scrutiny of non-representative OGs revealed high levels of split genes versus gene duplications, with both phenomena confounding gene orthology assignment. Interestingly, non-representative OGs, as well as OGs comprised of several gene families typically involved in microbial pathogenicity and/or the acquisition of virulence factors, fall predominantly within C2OG distributions. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Collectively, we determined the relative conservation and distribution of 14354 predicted ORFs from 10 rickettsial genomes across robust phylogeny estimation. The data, available at PATRIC (PathoSystems Resource Integration Center), provide novel information for unwinding the intricacies associated with Rickettsia pathogenesis, expanding the range of potential diagnostic, vaccine and therapeutic targets.},

@article{Gillespie2002,
	abstract = {Islands have traditionally been considered to be any relatively small body of land completely surrounded by water. However, their primary biological char- acteristic, an extended period of isolation from a source of colonists, is common also to many situations on continents. Accordingly, theories and predictions developed for true islands have been applied to a huge array of systems, from rock pools, to single tree species in forests, to oceanic islands. Here, we examine the literature on islands in the broadest sense (i.e., whether surrounded by water or any other uninhabitable matrix) as it pertains to terrestrial arthropods. We categorize islands according to the features they share. The primary distinction between different island systems is ?darwinian? islands (formed de novo) and ?fragment? islands. In the former, the islands have never been in contact with the source of colonists and have abundant ?empty? ecological niche space. On these islands, species numbers will initially increase through immigration, the rate depending on the degree of isolation. If isolation persists, over time species formation will result in ?neo-endemics.? When isolation is extreme, the ecological space will gradually be filled through speciation (rather than immigration) and adaptive radiation of neo-endemics. Fragment islands are fundamentally different. In these islands, the ecological space will initially be filled as a consequence of connection to the source of colonists prior to insularization. Species numbers will decrease following fragmenta- tion through the process of relaxation. If these islands become more isolated, species will eventually arise through relictualization with the formation of ?paleo-endemics.? Given sufficient time, this process can result in generic level endemism on ancient fragment islands, a phenomenon well illustrated in Madagascar and New Zealand. Recognizing the distinction between the different kinds of islands is fundamental for understanding emerging patterns on each, in particular speciation, biodiversity (e.g., neo-endemics versus paleo-endemics), and conservation (e.g., naivete ? in interactions with alien species).},

	abstract = {Accumulation of deleterious mutations has important consequences for the evolution of mating systems and the persistence of small populations. It is well established that consanguineous mating can purge a part of the mutation load and that lethal mutations can also be purged in small populations. However, the efficiency of purging in natural populations, due to either consanguineous mating or to reduced population size, has been questioned. Consequences of consanguineous mating systems and small population size are often equated under "inbreeding" because both increase homozygosity, and selection is though to be more efficient against homozygous deleterious alleles. I show that two processes of purging that I call "purging by drift" and "purging by nonrandom mating" have to be distinguished. Conditions under which the two ways of purging are effective are derived. Nonrandom mating can purge deleterious mutations regardless of their dominance level, whereas only highly recessive mutations can be purged by drift. Both types of purging are limited by population size, and sharp thresholds separate domains where purging is either effective or not. The limitations derived here on the efficiency of purging are compatible with some experimental studies. Implications of these results for conservation and evolution of mating systems are discussed.},

However, until very recently, population structure has not been taken into account, even though it can be an important factor in the evolution of populations. Population subdivision modifies the dynamics of deleterious mutations because the outcome of selection depends on processes both within populations (selection and drift) and between populations (migration). Here, we present a general model that permits us to gain insight into patterns of inbreeding depression, heterosis, and the load in subdivided populations. We show that they can be interpreted with reference to single-population theory, using an appropriate local effective population size that integrates the effects of drift, selection, and migration. We term this the "effective population size of selection" (NS(e)). For the infinite island model, for example, it is equal to NS(e) = N1 + m/hs, where N is the local population size, m the migration rate, and h and s the dominance and selection coefficients of deleterious mutation. Our results have implications for the estimation and interpretation of inbreeding depression in subdivided populations, especially regarding conservation issues. We also discuss the possible effects of migration and subdivision on the evolution of mating systems.},

	abstract = {Anolis lizards in the Greater Antilles partition the structural microhabitats available at a given site into four to six distinct categories. Most microhabitat specialists, or ecomorphs, have evolved only once on each island, yet closely related species of the same ecomorph occur in different geographic macrohabitats across the island. The extent to which closely related species of the same ecomorph have diverged to adapt to different geographic macro- habitats is largely undocumented. On the island of Hispaniola, members of the Anolis cybotes species group belong to the trunk-ground ecomorph category. Despite evolutionary stability of their trunk-ground microhabitat, populations of the A. cybotes group have undergone an evolutionary radiation associated with geographically distinct macrohabitats. A combined phylogeographic and morphometric study of this group reveals a strong association between macrohabitat type and morphology independent of phylogeny. This association results from long-term morphological evolutionary stasis in populations associated with mesic-forest environments (A. c. cybotes and A. marcanoi) and predictable morphometric changes associated with entry into new macrohabitat types (i.e., xeric forests, high-altitude pine forest, rock outcrops). Phylogeographic analysis of 73 new mitochondrial DNA sequences (1921 aligned sites) sampled from 68 geographic populations representing 12 recognized species and subspecies diagnoses 16 allopatric or parapatric groupings of populations differing from each other by 5--18{\%} sequence divergence. At least some of these groupings appear to have attained species-level divergence from others. Evolutionary specialization to different macrohabitat types may be a major factor in the evolutionary diversification of Greater Antillean anoles.},

	abstract = {Overwater dispersal and subsequent allopatric speciation contribute importantly to the species diversity of West Indian Anolis lizards and many other island radiations. Here we use molecular phylogenetic analyses to assess the contribution of overwater dispersal to diversification of the Anolis carolinensis subgroup, a clade comprising nine canopy-dwelling species distributed across the northern Caribbean. Although this clade includes some of the most successful dispersers and colonists in the anole radiation, the taxonomic status and origin of many endemic populations have been ambiguous. New mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences from four species occurring on small islands or island banks (Anolis brunneus, Anolis longiceps, Anolis maynardi, Anolis smaragdinus) and one species from the continental United States (A. carolinensis) are presented and analysed with homologous sequences sampled from related species on Cuba (Anolis allisoni and Anolis porcatus). Our analyses confirm that all five non-Cuban species included in our study represent distinct, independently evolving lineages that warrant continued species recognition. Moreover, our results support Ernest Williams's hypothesis that all of these species originated by overseas colonization from Cuban source populations. However, contrary to Williams's hypothesis of Pleistocene dispersal, most colonization events leading to speciation apparently occurred earlier, in the late Miocene-Pliocene. These patterns suggest that overwater dispersal among geologically distinct islands and island banks is relatively infrequent in anoles and has contributed to allopatric speciation. Finally, our results suggest that large Greater Antillean islands serve as centres of origin for regional species diversity.},

	abstract = {Barriers to dispersal and resulting biogeographic boundaries are responsible for much of life's diversity. Distinguishing the contribution of ecological, historical, and stochastic processes to the origin and maintenance of biogeographic boundaries, however, is a longstanding challenge. Taking advantage of newly available data and methods--including environmental niche models and associated comparative metrics--we develop a framework to test two possible ecological explanations for biogeographic boundaries: (1) sharp environmental gradients and (2) ribbons of unsuitable habitat dividing two highly suitable regions. We test each of these hypotheses against the null expectation that environmental variation across a given boundary is no greater than expected by chance. We apply this framework to a pair of Hispaniolan Anolis lizards (A. chlorocyanus and A. coelestinus) distributed on the either side of this island's most important biogeographic boundary. Integrating our results with historical biogeographic analysis, we find that a ribbon of particularly unsuitable habitat is acting to maintain a boundary between species that initially diverged on distinct paleo-islands, which merged to form present-day Hispaniola in the Miocene.},

	abstract = {The federally endangered North American Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) and the closely related Melissa blue butterfly (L. m. melissa) can be distinguished based on life history and morphology. Western populations of L. m. samuelis share mitochondrial haplotypes with L. m. melissa populations, while eastern populations of L. m. samuelis have divergent haplotypes. Here we test two hypotheses concerning the presence of L. m. melissa mitochondrial haplotypes in western L. m. samuelis populations: (i) mitochondrial introgression has occurred from L. m. melissa populations into western L. m. samuelis populations, or (ii) western populations of the nominal L. m. samuelis are more closely related to L. m. melissa than to eastern L. m. samuelis populations, yet are phenotypically similar to the latter. A Bayesian algorithm was used to cluster 190 L. melissa individuals based on 143 informative amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci. This method clearly differentiated L. m. samuelis and L. m. melissa. Thus, genomic divergence was greater between western L. m. samuelis populations and L. m. melissa populations than it was between western and eastern populations of L. m. samuelis. This supports the hypothesis that the presence of L. m. melissa mitochondrial haplotypes in western L. m. samuelis populations is the result of mitochondrial introgression. These data provide valuable information for conservation and management plans for the endangered L. m. samuelis, and illustrate the risks of using data from a single locus for diagnosing significant units of biodiversity for conservation.},

In this study, we investigated the effects of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril (L), and the combination of both drugs, given daily for 14 days to UUO rats, on the renal fibrogenic process triggered by UUO. METHODS: Rats underwent surgical UUO, followed by treatment with daily doses of either MMF, lisinopril, or both, and were then sacrificed after 14 days. Kidney fragments were fixed for histopathological examination (hematoxylin-eosin and periodic acid-Schiff reactive) and immunohistochemistry for myofibroblasts (alpha-smooth muscle actin; alpha-SMA) and macrophages (ED-1). Histomorphometrical analysis of collagen was performed with Sirius red staining, and collagen content was assessed by the amount of hydroxyproline. Cortex and medulla were analyzed separately. RESULTS: MMF, lisinopril and MMF+L reduced the density of alpha-SMA- and ED-1-positive cells (p {\textless} 0.05), interstitial volume (p {\textless} 0.05) and decreased Sirius-red-stained areas by 54.6, 35.6 and 58.0{\%}, and hydroxyproline content by 60.1, 49.7 and 62.7{\%}, respectively. No differences were observed among treated groups. CONCLUSION: MMF and the ACE inhibitor lisinopril attenuated the progression of the fibrogenic process of UUO in an equivalent manner. The combination of both drugs did not add any further improvement in the collagen content.},

The remaining natural population is too small and fragmented to yield information on the natural history and population biology of this species. Therefore, we studied habitat use in a population of captive-bred, released iguanas in a botanic park. Compositional analysis was used to examine habitat selection and use by iguanas at two scales: selection of home range within the landscape and selection of locations within home ranges. At both scales and for all time periods examined, iguanas preferred modified habitat to natural habitat. Subhabitats were examined only at the scale of selection within the landscape, for which iguanas showed preference in some but not all time periods. Iguanas used artificial retreats more often than natural retreats and commonly occupied retreats in modified areas. Many female iguanas nested in artificial sites within the park. The use of modified habitats and artificial retreats and nests by reintroduced C. lewisi is encouraging, because this and other species of Cyclura may depend on these resources for future survival. {\textcopyright} 2005 The Zoological Society of London.},

Iguanas were monitored using transect walks and radio telemetry during the summer and fall of 2002. Males used larger areas and had greater movement distances than females during tracking periods in the summer but not in the fall. Overall home ranges for both seasons combined were larger in males than in females. Some home-range estimates were greater than any previously reported in Cyclura. Several iguanas, especially males during the breeding season, used areas outside the park where they are vulnerable to increased predation, death by vehicle, and hunting or collection by humans. This, combined with the large average home-range sizes for this species, indicate that future reserves for C. lewisi should be large and surrounded by buffer zones or fences. Rock},

	abstract = {Methods for attaching radio transmitters to rock iguanas (genus Cyclura) are described and compared based on signal range, longevity of attachment, and potential disturbance to animal behavior or health. Case studies are described for all instances of internal implantation, ingestion, and external attachment of transmitters for which data are available. Signal range did not differ dramatically between attachment methods, but did differ between transmitter models and habitats in which iguanas were tracked. Only transmitters with coiled antennas showed a dramatic reduction in signal range. Longevity of transmitter attachment varied greatly among attachment methods, and was greatest for implantation, least for ingestion, and intermediate for external methods. Internal placement of transmitters via ingestion or implantation was advantageous in having no external apparatus to snag on vegetation or rocks. However, ingestion yielded less than one week of data, and implantation required costly, potentially stressful surgery. External attachment methods, including suturing of transmitters, mounting with adhesive, and harnesses or collars with breakaway mechanisms, entailed low cost and low risk, but were less reliable for long-term attachment. Harnesses or belts that lacked breakaway mechanisms entailed higher risk, because iguanas may suffer injury or death if not monitored frequently and recaptured for removal of attachment devices. In many studies, iguanas successfully mated, nested, and appeared to behave normally with transmitters attached by various methods. However, further research is needed to determine how different attachment methods affect the health, behavior, and survivorship of iguanas, particularly in smaller species and juveniles, which are more susceptible to predation.

In spite of its importance, ecologists have not always appreciated the effects of abundance and sampling effort on richness measures and comparisons. We survey a series of common pitfalls in quantifying and comparing taxon richness. These pitfalls can be largely avoided by using accumulation and rarefaction curves, which may be based on either individuals or samples. These taxon sampling curves contain the basic information for valid richness comparisons, including category$\pm$subcategory ratios (species-to-genus and species-to- individual ratios). Rarefaction methods $\pm$ both sample-based and individual-based $\pm$ allow for meaningful standardization and comparison of datasets. Standardizing data sets by area or sampling effort may produce very different results compared to standardizing by number of individuals collected, and it is not always clear which measure of diversity is more appropriate. Asymptotic richness estimators provide lower-bound estimates for taxon-rich groups such as tropical arthropods, in which observed richness rarely reaches an asymptote, despite intensive sampling. Recent examples of diversity studies of tropical trees, stream invertebrates, and herbaceous plants emphasize the importance of carefully quantifying species richness using taxon sampling curves.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in understanding the tectonic and paleoenvironmental history of the Caribbean region allow formulation of biogeographic and evolution/speciation models within an improved physical context. Support is developing for a new 'maximist' model of geological history suggesting that the Greater Antilles originated as a submerged volcanic island arc in the present Isthmian region during the Early Cretaceous [Valanginian; ∼130 m.y. (million years ago)] and moved more than 1000 km to their present location. Geologic investigations are not always concerned with whether an arc is submerged or emergent, but the proto-Greater Antillean arc began colliding with the Bahamas Platform in the Paleocene/earliest Eocene (∼56 m.y.), and the principal period of emergence allowing terrestrial flora and fauna to colonize was in the middle Eocene (∼49 m.y.). Early emergence was during the later phases of the hothouse interval of the Late Cretaceous through the early Eocene, which was followed by an intermediate period when climates fluctuated between non-glacial and (marginally) glacial conditions (middle Eocene through the early Miocene), and culminated in the icehouse interval of the late Tertiary and Quaternary Periods. The recent geological/paleoenvironmental models still constitute, however, a broad spectrum of possibilities for biogeographic-evolutionary-speciation events within which specialists must formulate the most probable pathway(s) for individual taxa.

	abstract = {Many West Indian rock iguanas Cyclura spp comprise small restricted island populations that are threatened by habitat conversion and degradation, free-ranging domestic animals and invasive species. In the 1980s, concerted conservation efforts were initiated for Caribbean iguanas, using a combination of captive-breeding programmes and head-starting of wild-collected hatchlings for reintroduction, and habitat protection. Zoological facilities have been involved in the conservation efforts from the start, providing expertise, resources and extensive funding for various aspects of the conservation programmes, and by providing space to house ex situ groups of iguanas as assurance populations. Health assessments of wild and captive iguanas, and databases related to the biology and health of the species have benefited not only the wild populations but also those being bred and maintained in captivity. Data compilation and analysis through the use of population-management software have made it possible to manage the genetic diversity of the individuals being captive bred for release. The involvement of zoological facilities has been fundamental to the efforts that have gone into bringing the Grand Cayman blue iguana Cyclura lewisi and the Jamaican iguana Cyclura collei back from the brink of extinction. A review of the conservation efforts for West Indian iguanas, including the role played by zoos, is presented.},

Significant differences in allele number among these populations were found. However, the heterozygosity among these populations was not statistically different. These results suggest that loss in allele diversity was faster than loss in heterozygosity. Conservation implications, particularly for golden lion tamarins, are then discussed.

@article{Gratton2017,
	abstract = {Aim Comparative phylogeography across a large number of species allows investigating community-level processes at regional and continental scales. An effective approach to such studies would involve automatic retrieval of georeferenced sequence data from nucleotide databases (a first step towards an `automated phylogeography'). It remains unclear if, despite repeated calls, georeferencing of nucleotide databases has increased in frequency, and if accumulated data allow for broad applications based on automated retrieval of sequence data and associated geographical information. Here, we investigated geographical information available in NCBI GenBank accessions for tetrapods, exploring temporal and geographical patterns in georeferencing, and quantifying data available for automated phylogeography. Location Global. Methods We developed Python and R scripts to (1) download metadata from GenBank (1,125,514 accessions, {\textgreater} 20,000 species); (2) geocode accessions from associated metadata; (3) map originally georeferenced and geocoded accessions and plot their frequency against time; (4) assess the size of intraspecific sets of homologous sequences and compare their geographical extent with species ranges, thus evaluating their potential for phylogeographical analyses. Results Only 6.2{\%} of surveyed tetrapod GenBank submissions reported geographical coordinates, without increase in recent years. Our geocoding raised georeferenced accessions to 15.1{\%}. The geographical distribution of georeferenced accessions is patchy, and especially sparse in economically underdeveloped areas. Automatically retrievable informative data sets covering most of the range are available for very few species of wide-ranging tetrapods. Main conclusions Although geocoding offers a partial solution to the scarcity of direct georeferencing, the amount of data potentially useful for automated phylogeography is still limited. Strong underrepresentation of hard-to-access areas suggests that sampling logistics represent a main hindrance to global data availability. We propose that, besides enhancing georeferencing of genetic data, future research agendas should focus on collaborative efforts to sample genetic diversity in biodiversity-rich tropical areas.},

It is of great significance in both human and veterinary medicine as a vector of several important pathogens and can also cause clinical illness in heavy infestations of dogs. However, there are still significant taxonomic uncertainties, and it is probable that some records of this tick refer to other species. Most past reviews have been broad-ranging or have focused on the pathogens that R. sanguineus transmits, and relatively few have considered its biology in detail or the issues around its true identity. The present review has paid most attention to the taxonomy of R. sanguineus and to the ecological factors that influence tick survival and distribution, particularly in a climate change context. It is evident that more research is required on the systematics of the R. sanguineus species complex, in order to elucidate the epidemiology and prevention of the diseases that it transmits, and to provide the relevant biological data required for development of predictive models of future tick distribution in a climate change scenario. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

	abstract = {Hydrocarbon profiles on the cuticle of social insects act as multi-component recognition cues used to identify membership in a species, a colony or, within colonies, cues about its reproductive status or task group. To examine the role of structural complexity in ant hydrocarbon recognition cues, we studied the species recognition response of two ant species, Linepithema humile and Aphaenogaster cockerelli, and the recognition of conspecifics by L. humile. The cuticular hydrocarbons of ants are composed of molecules of varying chain lengths from three structural classes, n-alkanes, methyl-branched alkanes and n-alkenes. We employed species recognition bioassays that measured the aggressive response of both species of ants to mixtures of hydrocarbon classes, single structural classes of hydrocarbons (n-alkanes, methyl-branched alkanes and n-alkenes), and controls. The results showed that a combination of at least two hydrocarbon structural classes was necessary to elicit an aggressive species recognition response. Moreover, no single class of hydrocarbons was more important than the others in eliciting a response. Similarly, in the recognition of conspecifics, Linepithema humile did not respond to a mixture of n-alkane cuticular hydrocarbons presented alone, but supplementation of nestmate hydrocarbon profiles with the n-alkanes did elicit high levels of aggression. Thus both L. humile and A. cockerelli required mixtures of hydrocarbons of different structural classes to recognize species and colony membership. It appears that information on species and colony membership is not in isolated components of the profile, but instead in the mixture of structural classes found in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles.},

	abstract = {The conservation of genetic variability has, until recently, played an insignificant role in most wildlife management policies, except perhaps where endangered plants or animals are involved. Even then, it was motivated by sentiment and by the traditional fear that loss of variability or heterozygosity may lead, through inbreeding depression, to extinction. Evidence is put forward that the conservation of genetic variation should be the prime consideration in the implementation of a nature conservation policy, for ecological, taxonomic and aesthetic reasons. This is best achieved by conserving the genetic integrity of population units somewhere between the hierarchical levels of deme and subspecies without unnecessary genetic admixture. It is suggested that the unthinking mixing of subspecies or ecotypes by 'conservationoriented' translocations is both biologically indefensible and ecologically harmful. The survival of life in a changing world depends upon evolution which in turn is completely dependent upon the existence of a full spectrum of genetic variation.},

@article{Grether2009,
	abstract = {The extent to which interspecific interference competition has contributed to character evolution is one of the most neglected problems in evolutionary biology. When formerly allopatric species come into secondary contact, aggressive interactions between the species can cause selection on traits that affect interspecific encounter rates (e.g. habitat preferences, activity schedules), competitor recognition (e.g. colouration, song), and fighting ability (e.g. weaponry, body size). We define agonistic character displacement (ACD) as the process of phenotypic evolution in a population caused by interference competition with one or more sympatric species and which results in shifts in traits that affect the rate, intensity or outcome of interspecific aggression. After clarifying the relationships between ACD and other evolutionary processes that may occur when species come into secondary contact, we develop an individual-based, quantitative genetic model to examine how traits involved in competitor recognition would be expected to evolve under different secondary contact scenarios. Our simulation results show that both divergence and convergence are possible outcomes, depending on the intensity of interspecific exploitative competition, the costs associated with mutual versus unilateral recognition, and the extent of phenotypic differences prior to secondary contact. We then devise a set of eight criteria for evaluating putative examples of ACD and review the empirical literature to assess the strength of existing evidence and to identify promising avenues for future research. Our literature search revealed 33 putative examples of ACD across insects, fishes, bats, birds, lizards, and amphibians (15 divergence examples; 18 convergence examples). Only one example satisfies all eight criteria for demonstrating ACD, but most case studies satisfy four or more criteria. The current state of the evidence for ACD is similar to the state of the evidence for ecological character displacement just 10 years ago. We conclude by offering suggestions for further theoretical and empirical research on ACD.},

A total of 988 base pairs (486 for Cytb, and 502 for COI) were aligned for 15 individuals of Maniola and an outgroup species. The phylogenetic tree obtained through Bayesian inference analysis of the combined data sets shows evidence that the island endemic M. chia is indistinguishable from M. jurtina on the basis of the mtDNA genes studied. Net nucleotide divergence between M. jurtina and M. chia is 0.4{\%}, but 2{\%} between the M. jurtina and the M. nurag clade. A phenetically distinct entity of individuals from Sardinia appears to be a hybrid between M. nurag and M. jurtina. The southern and northern European ecotypes of M. jurtina, which differ in the summer aestivation period of the southern type, are not structured genetically at the level of coding mtDNA genes. Divergence time between M. nurag and M. jurtina was estimated to be 1.1 to 1.2 million years. Speciation most likely took place in the early Pleistocene as a consequence of the isolation of Sardinia, when the sea reflooded the Mediterranean basin after the Messinian crisis (about 5 million years ago).},

	abstract = {Recently refined evolutionary theories have highlighted that ecological interactions and environmental gradients can play a major role in speciation. This paper reports on a 3-year field study, in which the ecology of two congeneric butterfly species was used to explore and compare the environmental factors determining their spatial distribution. These data are discussed in the context of possible speciation scenarios between the Sardinian populations of Maniola nurag and M. jurtina. M. nurag is endemic to the island of Sardinia, while M. jurtina is widespread over Europe. In Sardinia, the two species are locally sympatric. Mark--release--recapture experiments were combined with measures of environmental variables in 15 1-ha plots, established in areas of potential habitat for the butter- flies. Constrained linear models were parameterized from mark--recapture data to estimate both individual (survival and capture probabilities) and population (population size and recruitment) parameters. The two species had similar demography, movement patterns, life history, and behaviour. Population sizes developed in a parabolic fashion from beginning to end of the flight season. Differences included local population size, adult phenology, and habitat require- ments. Long-distance movements larger than 1.5 km were observed, suggesting a substantial amount of gene-flow between populations of the endemic as well as the widespread species. Multivariate analyses revealed four main environmental gradients responsible for the abundance of the butterflies in an area. Both species responded simi- larly to environmental variables. However, each species's abundance was correlated with a different environmental gradient determined by vegetation cover and structure. When sympatric, the two species responded to subtle dif- ferences in microhabitat structure. This might originally have induced their divergence. This study is an example of how empirical field data on population dynamics, dispersal, and habitat characteristics of two sympatric congeners can further our understanding of how species differentiate despite existing gene-flow. {\textcopyright}},

These differences may affect both our ability to detect inbreeding depression in threatened species, and our interpretation of the underlying mechanisms for observed heterozygosity-fitness relationships.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Estimation of genotypic diversity is an important component of the analysis of the genetic structure of plant pathogen and microbial populations. Estimates of genotypic diversity are a function of both the number of genotypes observed in a sample (genotype richness) and the evenness of distribution of genotypes within the sample. Currently used measures of genotypic diversity have inherent problems that could lead to incorrect conclusions, particularly when diversity is low or sample sizes differ. The number of genotypes observed in a sample depends on the technique used to assay for genetic variation; each technique will affect the maximum number of genotypes that can be detected. We developed an approach to analysis of genotypic diversity in plant pathology that makes specific reference to the techniques used for identifying genotypes. Preferably, populations that are being compared should be very similar in sample size. In this case, the number of genotypes observed can be used directly for co...},

For this purpose, 400 adults of A. cajenennse and 200 adults of A. dubitatum, plus 2,000 larvae and 2,000 nymphs of Amblyomma spp. were collected from horses and from the vegetation. The ticks were tested for rickettsial infection through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols targeting portions of three rickettsial genes (gltA, ompA, and ompB). Only two free‑living A. cajennense adult ticks, and four pools of free-living Amblyomma spp. nymphs were shown to contain rickettsial DNA. PCR products from the two A. cajennense adult ticks were shown to be identical to corresponding sequences of the Rickettsia rickettsii strain Sheila Smith. DNA sequences of gltA-PCR products of the four nymph pools of Amblyomma spp. revealed a new genotype, which was shown to be closest (99.4{\%}) to the corresponding sequence of Rickettsia tamurae. Our findings of two R. rickettsii-infected A. cajennense ticks corroborate the endemic status of the study area, where human cases of BSF were reported recently.

In order to assess these impacts, phenotypic and genotypic data pertaining to young-of-the-year (YOY) sole (Solea solea) were screened in differentially contaminated North East Atlantic estuaries ranging from Portugal (Mondego) to the English Channel (Seine). YOY sole inhabiting each estuary was found being phenotypically distinct from each other; each of them being impacted by pollution when comparing observed phenotypic data with published literature. According to the strong pollution in the Seine estuary, the corresponding YOY sole sample showed significantly lower body mass, size and condition factor compared to other samples. Using fifteen genetic markers, the Mondego estuary demonstrated low, but significant levels of genetic differentiation with most of the samples. Using neutrality tests, two loci were found to be putatively under directional selection (Soso7 and Soso23), but only locus Soso7 demonstrated significant positive heterozygosity-fitness correlation (HFC) for body size and body mass, suggesting a possible ongoing adaptive process. The candidate locus MT associated to a detoxifying metallothionein gene did not show significant genetic differentiation, but (i) significant deficit in heterozygote in the Seine estuary as already reported in other coastal samples impacted by metallic contaminants, and (ii) significant positive HFC with body mass were found. Selective rather than demographic processes better explain an observed genetic structure in YOY sole and are predominantly associated with the heavily contaminated Seine estuary whose nursery function and capacity are degraded. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Because of its importance, much attention has been devoted to tests of Hardy-Weinberg proportions (HWP) over the decades. It has long been recognized that large-sample goodness-of-fit tests can sometimes lead to spurious results when the sample size and/or some genotypic frequencies are small. Although a complete enumeration algorithm for the exact test has been proposed, it is not of practical use for loci with more than a few alleles due to the amount of computation required. We propose two algorithms to estimate the significance level for a test of HWP. The algorithms are easily applicable to loci with multiple alleles. Both are remarkably simple and computationally fast. Relative efficiency and merits of the two algorithms are compared. Guidelines regarding their usage are given. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the practicality of the algorithms.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic networks are models of evolution that go beyond trees, allowing biological operations that are not consistent with tree-like evolution. One of the most important of these biological operations is recombination between two sequences (homologous chromosomes). The algorithmic problem of reconstructing a history of recombinations, or determining the minimum number of recombinations needed, has been studied in a number of papers [10, 11, 12, 23, 24, 25, 16, 13, 14, 6, 9, 8, 18, 19, 15, 1]. In [9, 6, 10, 8, 1] we introduced and used "conflict graphs" and "incompatibility graphs" to compute lower bounds on the minimum number of recombinations needed, and to efficiently solve constrained cases of the minimization problem. In those results, the non-trivial connected components of the graphs were the key features that were used. In this paper we more fully develop the structural importance of nontrivial connected components of the incompatibility graph, to establish a fundamental decomposition theorem about phylogenetic networks. The result applies to phylogenetic networks where cycles reflect biological phenomena other than recombination, such as recurrent mutation and lateral gene transfer. The proof leads to an efficient O(nm2) time algorithm to find the underlying maximal tree structure defined by the decomposition, for any set of n sequences of length m each. An implementation of that algorithm is available. We also report on progress towards resolving the major open problem in this area. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

	abstract = {The primary mechanism of gene flow in marine sessile invertebrates is larval dispersal. In Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae, a commercially important Caribbean gorgonian coral, a proportion of the larvae drop to the substratum within close proximity to the maternal colony, and most matings occur between individuals in close proximity to each other. Such limited dispersal of reproductive propagules suggests that gene flow is limited in this gorgonian. In this study, we characterized the population genetic structure of P. elisabethae across the Bahamas using six microsatellite loci. P. elisabethae was collected from 18 sites across the Bahamas. Significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium due to deficits of heterozygotes within populations were detected for all 18 populations in at least one of the six screened loci. Levels of genetic structure among populations of P. elisabethae were high and significant. A distance analysis placed populations within three groups, one formed by populations located within Exuma Sound, a semi-isolated basin, another consisting of populations located outside the basin and a third group comprising two populations from San Salvador Island. The patterns of genetic variation found in this study are concordant with the life-history traits of the species and in part with the geography of the Bahamas. Conservation and management plans developed for P. elisabethae should considered the high degree of genetic structure observed among populations of the species, as well as the high genetic diversity found in the San Salvador and the Exuma Sound populations.},

	abstract = {In many plants and animal species, asexuals are more common in marginal habitats such as high latitudes or altitudes than their closely related sexual counterparts. Here we propose a new hypothesis to explain this pattern called ``geographic parthenogen- esis''. In marginal habitats, populations may often exist as metapopulations with high degrees of subdivision and local extinction and recolonization, resulting in genetic bottlenecks during colonization. Our hypothesis states that such dynamics could play a key role in geographic parthenogenesis. Genetic bottlenecks and subsequent drift have stronger negative fitness consequences in sexuals than in asexuals because genetic drift leads to increased homozygosity and inbreeding depression in sexual but not in asexual populations. Migration, leading to inter-population hybridisation, may induce tempo- rary fitness recovery in sexuals. Asexuals arising from such hybrids have an increased likelihood of invading sexual populations because they keep their high fitness, whereas the fitness of sexuals is doomed to decrease due to subsequent inbreeding and inbreed- ing depression. Therefore, asexuals may replace sexuals in subdivided habitats with local extinction and recolonization while they would not succeed in unstructured habi- tats without local turnover dynamics},

	abstract = {The deleterious effects of inbreeding have long been known, and inbreeding can increase the risk of extinction for local populations in metapopulations. However, other consequences of inbreeding in metapopulations are still not well understood. Here we show the presence of strong inbreeding depression in a rockpool metapopulation of the planktonic freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna, which reproduces by cyclical parthenogenesis. We conducted three experiments in real and artificial rockpools to quantify components of inbreeding depression in the presence and the absence of competition between clonal lines of selfed and outcrossed genotypes. In replicated asexual populations, we recorded strong selection against clones produced by selfing in competition with clones produced by outcrossing. In contrast, inbreeding depression was much weaker in single-clone populations, that is, in the absence of competition between inbred and outbred clones. The finding of a competitive advantage of the outbred genotypes in this metapopulation suggests that if rockpool populations are inbred, hybrid offspring resulting from crosses between immigrants and local genotypes might have a strong selective advantage. This would increase the effective gene flow in the metapopulation. However, the finding of low inbreeding depression in the monoclonal populations suggests that inbred and outbred genotypes might have about equal chances of establishing new populations.},

@article{Haag2007,
	abstract = {In diploid organisms, sexual reproduction rearranges allelic combinations between loci (recombination) as well as within loci (segregation). Several studies have analyzed the effect of segregation on the genetic load due to recurrent deleterious mutations, but considered infinite populations, thus neglecting the effects of genetic drift. Here, we use single-locus models to explore the combined effects of segregation, selection, and drift. We find that, for partly recessive deleterious alleles, segregation affects both the deterministic component of the change in allele frequencies and the stochastic component due to drift. As a result, we find that the mutation load may be far greater in asexuals than in sexuals in finite and/or subdivided populations. In finite populations, this effect arises primarily because, in the absence of segregation, heterozygotes may reach high frequencies due to drift, while homozygotes are still efficiently selected against; this is not possible with segregation, as matings between heterozygotes constantly produce new homozygotes. If deleterious alleles are partly, but not fully recessive, this causes an excess load in asexuals at intermediate population sizes. In subdivided populations without extinction, drift mostly occurs locally, which reduces the efficiency of selection in both sexuals and asexuals, but does not lead to global fixation. Yet, local drift is stronger in asexuals than in sexuals, leading to a higher mutation load in asexuals. In metapopulations with turnover, global drift becomes again important, leading to similar results as in finite, unstructured populations. Overall, the mutation load that arises through the absence of segregation in asexuals may greatly exceed previous predictions that ignored genetic drift.},

	abstract = {Although growing numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellites (short tandem repeat polymorphisms or STRPs) are used to infer population structure, their relative properties in this context remain poorly understood. SNPs and STRPs mutate differently, suggesting multi-locus genotypes at these loci might differ in ability to detect population structure. Here, we use coalescent simulations to measure the power of sets of SNPs and STRPs to identify population structure. To maximize the applicability of our results to empirical studies, we focus on the popular STRUCTURE analysis and evaluate the role of several biological and practical factors in the detection of population structure. We find that: (1) fewer unlinked STRPs than SNPs are needed to detect structure at recent divergence times {\textless}0.3 N(e) generations; (2) accurate estimation of the number of populations requires many fewer STRPs than SNPs; (3) for both marker types, declines in power due to modest gene flow (N(e)m=1.0) are largely negated by increasing marker number; (4) variation in the STRP mutational model affects power modestly; (5) SNP haplotypes ($\theta$=1, no recombination) provide power comparable with STRP loci ($\theta$=10); (6) ascertainment schemes that select highly variable STRP or SNP loci increase power to detect structure, though ascertained data may not be suitable to other inference; and (7) when samples are drawn from an admixed population and one of its parent populations, the reduction in power to detect two populations is greater for STRPs than SNPs. These results should assist the design of multi-locus studies to detect population structure in nature.},

Northern Africa is one of the possibly important refugia. In this study we test the genetic differentiation between northern African and European populations, using the marbled white butterfly species complex, Melanargia galathea/M. lachesis, as a model. We studied 18 allozyme loci in 876 individuals from 23 populations representing a major part of Europe (northern Spain to Romania) and the western part of northern Africa (Atlas Mountains). The African populations resemble the European ones in allelic richness; their genetic diversity is higher than in Europe. Cluster analysis discriminated five European genetic groups: M. lachesis, a western European lineage, and three eastern European lineages. However, the African samples did not form a separate cluster within this phenogram, but clustered randomly within the Balkan/southeastern European groups. The genetic differentiation among the African populations (F
                        ST 8.8{\%}) was higher than that within any of the European lineages (F
                        ST 2.6-5.5{\%}). The high genetic diversity and the relatively strong differentiation of the four African populations sampled in a comparatively limited area of the Atlas Mountains indicate that the most probable origin of M. galathea is northern Africa, with its sibling species, M. lachesis, evolving in parallel in Iberia. Most probably, M. galathea colonised Europe first during the Eem interglacial, some 130 ky ago. Since M. lachesis must have existed on the Iberian peninsula during that period already, M. galathea should have reached Europe via Italy. The genetic differentiation to distinct groups in Europe most probably evolved during the following W??rm glacial period. ?? 2007 Gesellschaft f??r Biologische Systematik.},

	abstract = {The sea acts as an effective dispersal barrier for most terrestrial animal species. Narrow sea straits, therefore, often represent areas where species are able to disperse from one land mass to another. In the Mediterranean Sea, the narrowest connecting points between North Africa and Europe are the Strait of Gibraltar and the Strait of Sicily. In the past, climatic oscillations caused changing sea levels and thus influenced the permeability of these sea straits. We analysed the genetic structure of four butterfly species that all occur on both sides of the Strait of Sicily. In all four species, we observed a lack of genetic differentiation between the populations of North Africa and those of Italy. Species distribution models support the strong cohesiveness in that they show a largely continuous glacial distribution over Italy and North Africa. The data obtained reveal that there was a large exchange of individuals between Italy and the eastern Maghreb during the last ice age. This might not only be the case for the species under investigation in the present study, but also might represent a more general pattern for mobile thermophilic western Palearctic species. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2010, 99, 818--830.},

The species is evolutionarily distinct and diverged from its nearest relatives during the Oligocene. To expand on the limited information available with respect to the life history and ecology of C. zebrata in the wild, we explored the species' prevalence to group living and the fine-scale genetic structure of a large and isolated population. Fifty-one lizards were sampled in a 900-ha study plot within a larger area of continuous rain forest on Ugi Island in the Solomon Islands, an area that represents approximately 20{\%} of the C. zebrata habitat on the island. Using information from eight polymorphic DNA microsatellite loci, we conducted Bayesian assignment analysis and pairwise kinship estimates between individual lizards. No geographically induced subpopulation structure was detected. The majority of lizards were not found in immediate proximity of other individuals; however, pairwise kinship analysis showed that lizards located less than 150 m from each other were likely to share alleles identical by descent and, thus, were more related than by chance. Additionally, we found indications that individual lizards have moved several kilometers within the study area. We have uncovered information on dispersal and genetic structure in a large population of C. zebrata, a species whose natural habitat across the Solomon Archipelago is increasingly fragmented and degraded because of unsustainable logging.},

We detect positive selection, purifying ("negative") selection, and population expansion in our experiment. We also present a statistical test that is able to distinguish demographic from selective events, processes that are hard to identify individually because both often produce an excess of rare mutations. Our "heterogeneity test" modifies common statistics measuring the frequency spectrum of polymorphism (e.g., Fu and Li's D) by looking for processes producing different patterns on nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations. Test results agree with the known conditions of the experiment, and we are therefore confident that this test offers a tool to evaluate natural populations. Our results suggest that instances of segregating deleterious mutations may be common, but as yet undetected, in nature.},

This provides the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service with a means to target the most critical unit in need of conservation. Although roughly one-quarter of listed taxa are subspecies, these management agencies are hindered by uncertainties about taxonomic standards during listing or delisting activities. In a review of taxonomic publications and societies, we found few subspecies lists and none that stated standardized criteria for determining subspecific taxa. Lack of criteria is attributed to a centuries-old debate over species and subspecies concepts. Nevertheless, the critical need to resolve this debate for ESA listings led us to propose that minimal biological criteria to define disjunct subspecies (legally or taxonomically) should include the discreteness and significance criteria of distinct population segments (as defined under the ESA). Our subspecies criteria are in stark contrast to that proposed by supporters of the phylogenetic species concept and provide a clear distinction between species and subspecies. Efforts to eliminate or reduce ambiguity associated with subspecies-level classifications will assist with ESA listing decisions. Thus, we urge professional taxonomic societies to publish and periodically update peer-reviewed species and subspecies lists. This effort must be paralleled throughout the world for efficient taxonomic conservation to take place.},

The target population of this study was a group of municipal workers who reported exposure in a domestic setting and/or in the workplace. When asked if they were exposed to ETS on social occasions, both males and females who responded positively had higher urinary cotinine levels (P less than 0.02) than those who gave a negative response. Mean urinary cotinine concentrations were found to be elevated in both men and women who reported that they lived with a smoker. Cotinine levels in the urine of those reporting exposure were over twice as high as those in the urine of respondents who denied having been exposed. ETS exposure in the home was the greatest contributor to increased urinary cotinine levels in both men and women. Among individuals who were exposed at work only, the reported degree of exposure agreed well with the mean urinary cotinine values.

	abstract = {Molecular detection of pathogenic microorganisms in ticks is based on DNA amplification of the target pathogen; therefore, extraction of DNA from the tick is a major step. In this study, we compared three different tick DNA extraction protocols based on an enzymatic digestion by proteinase K followed by DNA extraction by a commercial kit ( method 1), or on mortar crushing, proteinase K digestion and phenol/chloroform DNA extraction ( method 2) and fine crushing with a beads beater, proteinase K digestion and DNA extraction using a commercial kit ( method 3). The absence of PCR inhibitors and the DNA quality were evaluated by PCR amplification of the tick mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene using tick-specific primers. With method 1, 23/30 (77{\%}) of the samples were extracted; with method 2, 30/31 (97{\%}) of the samples were extracted and with method 3, 30/30 (100{\%}) of the samples were extracted. DNA extraction efficiency using method 3 is significantly higher than DNA extraction efficiency using method 1 ( 100{\%} versus 77{\%}, P {\textless} 0.05). There was no significant difference between methods 2 and 3. Method 3 was however more adapted to cohort studies than method 2. This technique was validated for cohort tick DNA extraction and applicable to the treatment of small samples such as nymphs and soft ticks with 100{\%} efficiency.},

	abstract = {Analysis of 13 permanent sample plots (quadrats) in the Gal{\'{a}}pagos showed that recent elimination or reduction of the populations of feral goats has been followed by a regeneration of the vegetation. On Santa F{\'{e}}, where the vegetation is dry season deciduous, goats were eradicated in 1971; since then the density of woody plants in the quadrats has increased. However, only about half the woody species present participate in the recolinisation, and some of the remaining species appear to have been reduced so much in number that re-establishment will be very slow or even impossible. On Pinta island about 40 000 feral goats were shot during the period 1971-1977 and it is estimated that only a few thousand are left. In the arial lowlands a rapid regeneration is under way: the density and number of woody plant species occurring in the quadrats is increasing. Almost all species of woody plants appear to have survived in sufficient numbers to enable recolonisation of the area as soon as the grazing pressure is diminished. Some of the species seem to increase in abundance by means of rapid growth and maturity, subsequent large seed production, and rapid establishment of seedlings. In the evergreen vegetation types of the humid highlands of Pinta a rapid regeneration is also taking place, but here much probably takes place as regrowth from old stems and rhizomes. Both the density and number of woody plant species is increasing, and at the same time the herb cover is changing into more fern-rich communities. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list - reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The simplest models of metapopulation dynamics make predictions about the effects of habitat fragmentation - size and isolation of habitat patches - on metapopulation persistence. The simple models may be enriched by considerations of the effects of demographic and environmental stochasticity on the size and extinction probability of local populations. Environmental stochasticity affects populations at two levels: it makes local extinctions more probable, and it also decreases metapopulation persistence time by increasing the correlation of extinction events across populations. Some controversy has arisen over the significance of correlated extinctions, and how they may affect the optimal subdivision of metapopulations to maximize their persistence time.},

The significance of the following factors to metapopulation dynamics are explored: evolutionary changes in colonization ability; habitata patch size and isolation; compensatory effects between colonization and extinction rates; the effect of immigration on local dynamics (the rescue effect); and heterogeneity among habitat patches. The rescue effect may lead to alternative stable equilibria in metapopulation dynamics. Heterogeneity among habitat patches may give rise to bimodal equilibrium distribution of the fraction of patches occupied in an assemblage of species (the core-satellite distribution). A new model of incidence functions is described, which allows one to estimate species' colonization and extinction rates on islands colonized from the mainland. Four distinct kinds of stochasticity affecting metapopulation dynamics are discussed with examples. The concluding section describes four possible scenarios of metapopulation extinction.},

	abstract = {Marker-based studies of inbreeding may lead to an enhanced understanding of inbreeding depression in natural populations, which is a major concern in conservation genetics. Correlations between marker heterozygosity and variation in fitness-associated traits-'heterozygosity-fitness correlations' (HFCs)-are of particular importance and have been widely applied in natural populations. In partially inbred populations, HFCs can be driven by selection against inbred individuals and thus reflect inbreeding depression. However, other explanations for HFCs also exist, such as functional effects of the markers per se or that the markers reveal selection on linked fitness genes due to extended linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the population. Accordingly, HFCs do not only arise in partially inbred populations, they may also occur within inbreeding classes such as families, i.e. in situations when there is no variation in the inbreeding coefficient. In this study we focus on the importance of LD for within-family HFCs, thereby aiming at enhancing our general understanding of HFCs. For non-coding markers, within-family HFCs have been proposed to be caused in two ways: either by 'local effects' at linked fitness genes in LD with the markers, or by 'general effects' due to a correlation between proportion of heterozygous markers (H-M ) and heterozygosity at genome-wide distributed fitness genes (H-GW ). To evaluate these contrasting hypotheses for within-family HFCs, we analysed simulated data sets of sexually reproducing populations with varying levels of LD. The results confirmed that segregation induces variation in both H-M and H-GW at a fixed level of inbreeding; as expected, the variation in H-M declined with increasing number of markers, whereas the variation in H-GW declined with decreasing LD. However, less intuitively, there was no positive correlation between the variation in H-M and H-GW within inbreeding classes when the local component of H-GW was accounted for (i.e. when the part of the chromosome in LD with the markers was excluded). This strongly suggests that within-family HFCs are not caused by general effects. Instead, our results support the idea that HFCs at a known level of inbreeding can be driven by local effects in populations with high to moderate LD. Note however that we define the local component of H-GW as the part of the chromosomes in LD with the markers. This implies that when LD is high, the local component will consist of a substantial part of the genome and thus provides a rather 'genome-wide' view. We caution against routinely interpreting positive HFCs as evidence of inbreeding depression and non-significant HFCs as lack thereof, especially when few markers are used.},

	abstract = {Inbreeding depression may drive the evolution of inbreeding avoidance through dispersal and mate choice. In birds, many species show female-biased dispersal, which is an effective inbreeding avoidance mechanism. In contrast, there is scarce evidence in birds for kin discriminative mate choice, which may, at least partly, reflect difficulties detecting it. First, kin discrimination may be realized as dispersal, and this is difficult to distinguish from other causes of dispersal. Second, even within small, isolated populations, it is often difficult to determine the potential candidates available to a female when choosing a mate. We sought evidence for inbreeding avoidance via kin discrimination in a breeding population of great reed warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) studied over 17 years. Inbreeding depression is strong in the population, suggesting that it would be adaptive to avoid relatives as mates. Detailed data on timing of settlement and mate search movements made it possible to identify candidate mates for each female, and long-term pedigrees and resolved parentage enabled us to estimate relatedness between females and their candidate mates. We found no evidence for kin discrimination: mate choice was random with respect to relatedness when all mate-choice events were considered, and, after correction for multiple tests, also in all breeding years. We suggest that dispersal is a sufficient inbreeding avoidance mechanism in most situations, although the lack of kin discriminative mate choice has negative consequences for some females, because they end up mating with closely related males that lowers their fitness.},

	abstract = {Heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFCs) at noncoding genetic markers are commonly assumed to reflect fitness effects of heterozygosity at genomewide distributed genes in partially inbred populations. However, in populations with much linkage disequilibrium (LD), HFCs may arise also as a consequence of selection on fitness loci in the local chromosomal vicinity of the markers. Recent data suggest that relatively high levels of LD may prevail in many ecological situations. Consequently, LD may be an important factor, together with partial inbreeding, in causing HFCs in natural populations. In the present study, we evaluate whether LD can generate HFCs in a small and newly founded population of great reed warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus). For this purpose dyads of full siblings of which only one individual survived to adult age (i.e., returned to breed at the study area) were scored at 19 microsatellite loci, and at a gene region of hypothesized importance for survival, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). By examining siblings, we controlled for variation in the inbreeding coefficient and thus excluded genome-wide fitness effects in our analyses. We found that recruited individuals had significantly higher multilocus heterozygosity (MLH), and mean d2 (a microsatellite-specific variable), than their nonrecruited siblings. There was a tendency for the survivors to have a more diverse MHC than the nonsurvivors. Single-locus analyses showed that the strength of the genotype-survival association was especially pronounced at four microsatellite loci. By using genotype data from the entire breeding population, we detected significant LD between five of 162 pairs of microsatellite loci after accounting for multiple tests. Our present finding of a significant within-family multilocus heterozygosity-survival association in a nonequilibrium population supports the view that LD generates HFCs in natural populations.},

	abstract = {Analysis of the spatial genetic structure within continuous populations in their natural habitat can reveal acting evolutionary processes. Spatial autocorrelation statistics are often used for this purpose, but their relationships with population genetics models have not been thoroughly established. Moreover, it has been argued that the dependency of these statistics on variation in mutation rates among loci strongly limits their interest for inferential purposes. In the context of an isolation by distance process, we describe relationships between a descriptor of the spatial genetic structure used in empirical studies, Moran's I statistic and population genetics parameters. In particular, we point out that, when Moran's I statistic is used to describe correlation in allele frequencies at the individual level, it provides an estimator of Wright's coefficient of relationship. We also show that the latter parameter, as a descriptor of genetic structure, is not influenced by selfing rate or ploidy level. Under specific finite population models, numerical simulations show that values of Moran's I statistic can be predicted from analytical theory. These simulations are also used to estimate the time taken to approach a structure at equilibrium. Finally, we discuss the conditions under which spatial autocorrelation statistics are little influenced by variation in mutation rates, so that they could be used to estimate gene dispersal parameters.},

@article{Harmon2008,
	abstract = {---We examine the effects of ecological opportunity and geographic area on rates of species accumulation and morphological evolution following archipelago colonization in day geckos (genus Phelsuma) in the Indian Ocean. Using a newly generated molecular phylogeny for the genus, we present evidence that these geckos likely originated on Madagas-car, whereas colonization of three archipelagos in the Indian Ocean, the Seychelles, Mascarene, and Comoros Islands has produced three independent monophyletic radiations. We find that rates of species accumulation are not elevated following colonization but are roughly equivalent on all three isolated archipelagos and on the larger island of Madagascar. However, rates of species accumulation have slowed through time on Madagascar. Rates of morphological evolution are higher in both the Mascarene and Seychelles archipelagos compared to rates on Madagascar. This negative relationship between rate of morphological evolution and island area suggests that ecological opportunity is an important factor in diversification of day gecko species. [Adaptive radiation; Indian Ocean; molecular phylogeny; speciation. rate of evolution.] Both geography and ecological opportunity are thought to play a key role in species diversification. Many species groups have diversified extensively upon reaching geographically isolated islands uninhabited by potential competitors (see Grant, 1998, and references therein). For example, in the Hawaiian islands, silver-swords (Robichaux et al., 1990), songbirds (Lovette et al., 2002), and Tetragnatha spiders (Gillespie et al., 1994; Gillespie, 2004) have all speciated and diversified eco-logically to a much greater extent than their closest mainland relatives. In many cases, these lineages have undergone adaptive radiations, in which a single ances-tral species diversifies to fill a wide range of ecological niches (Schluter, 2000). Most considerations of the role of ecological opportu-nity in diversification have focused on interspecific com-petition for resources (Grant, 1968; Schluter, 1988, 2000; Barton, 1996). In this framework, rates of diversification should be highest immediately following arrival in a new habitat (Simpson, 1944). After this initial stage, diversifi-cation might slow as niche space becomes filled (Schluter, 2000); alternatively, species might continue to diversify along additional axes, like coloration or behavior (Streel-man and Danley, 2003). Theory and empirical data suggest that most speci-ation is allopatric and initiated by geographic barriers to gene flow (Coyne and Orr, 2004) and often features ecological divergence of populations (reviewed by Run-dle and Nosil, 2005). Geographic barriers permit local adaptation and spur phenotypic differentiation among populations and species. If opportunity for diversifica-tion depends on geographic area, rates of diversification should be highest on large archipelagos or continents. This model is supported by empirical findings that speci-ation rate is positively correlated with island area (Losos and Schluter, 2000).},

The popularity of this molecule derives, in part, from the relative ease with which clearly homologous sequences can be isolated and compared. Simple sequence organization, maternal inheritance and absence of recombination make mtDNA an ideal marker for tracing maternal genealogies. Rapid rate of sequence divergence (at least in vertebrates) allows discrimination of recently diverged lineages. Studies of mtDNAs from a diversity of animal groups have revealed significant variation among taxa in mtDNA sequence dynamics, gene order and genome size.

Furthermore, the performance of assignment tests in cases with low population differentiation, violations of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and unbalanced sampling designs has not been verified. The release of adult hatchery steelhead to spawn in Forks Creek in 1996 and 1997 provided an opportunity to compare the power of different assignment methods to distinguish their offspring from those of sympatric wild steelhead. We compared standard assignment methods requiring baseline samples (frequency, distance and Bayesian) and clustering approaches with and without baseline information, using six freely available computer programs. Assignments were verified by parentage data obtained for a subset of returning offspring. All methods provided similar assignment success, despite low differentiation between wild and hatchery fish (FST = 0.02). Bayesian approaches with baseline data performed best, whereas the results of clustering methods were variable and depended on the samples included in the analysis and the availability of baseline information. Removal of a locus with null alleles and equalizing sample sizes had little effect on assignments. Our results demonstrate the robustness of most assignment tests to low differentiation and violations of assumptions, as well as their utility for ecological studies that require correct classification of different groups. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors.},

The mouse X rat hybrids were isolated by fusion of chloramphenicol-sensitive (CAPs) mouse and CAP-resistant (CAPr) rat cells. The rat cybrids were isolated by fusion of rat cells with type B mtDNA and enucleated cells with type A mtDNA. Genetic and physical analyses showed that the mtDNAs of the hybrids and cybrids were simple mixtures of the two parental mtDNAs except in the following two cases: One was subclone H29 of mouse X rat hybrids, which was CAPr even though mtDNA from the CAPs mouse parent was predominantly retained. The other was rat cybrid subclones, Y1224 and -61, which showed specific loss of one Hinf I fragment of type B mtDNA, B10. These observations suggest that, in contrast to the case with plant mtDNA, recombination of mammalian mtDNA occurs rarely, if at all. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

We also examined the effects of additional variables (principally elevation) as covariates in our neighbourhood analyses, 3 Both the spatial and initial neighbourhood analyses suggested strong intra- and interspecific density-dependent effects on tree survival, Douglas fir survival was significantly higher in less dense patches of conspecifics and non-random tree death led to regularly spaced survivors, as expected from intraspecific competition. The significantly lower survival of western hemlock in denser patches of Douglas fir and the resulting negative spatial association between surviving trees of these two species were consistent with interspecific competition. 4 However, having controlled for the influence of elevation on tree survival (probably mediated by variation in soil moisture) in neighbourhood analyses, although the survival of the pioneer Douglas fir trees was still subject to strong density-dependent effects., variation in its density in the overstorey no longer appeared to influence the survival of the invading late-successional species, There was, however, evidence for asymmetric interspecific density dependence between the two late-successional species since western hemlock mortality tended to be higher in denser patches of western red cedar. 5 Our results emphasize the importance of considering confounding factors in studies that seek evidence for density dependence.},

	abstract = {The vertebrate fauna of theWest Indies (1262 species) exhibits high levels of endemism and has a taxonomic composition characteristic of more isolated oceanic islands. Many groups that are widespread on the mainland are absent in the islands, and some of those present are characterized by large adaptive radiations. The growing fossil record of West Indian vertebrates, including mid-Tertiary amber fossils (considered here to be 20--30 million years old), indicates that this pattern of reduced higher-taxon diversity has persisted for a long period of time. Phylogenetic relationships of nonvolant groups display a strong South American influence, whereas volant groups (birds and bats) and freshwater fish show closer ties with Central and North America. Molecular estimates of divergence times between island taxa and their mainland counterparts indicate a Cenozoic origin (within the last 65 million years) for nearly all groups examined. Together, data from different sources point to an origin by overwater dispersal for a large majority of the vertebrate fauna. The prevailing current direction, from southeast to northwest, and the wide scattering of estimated times of origin suggest that much of the nonvolant fauna arrived by flotsam carried from the mouths of major rivers in northeastern South America. Spatial relationships, especially considering low sea levels during the Pleistocene, appear to better explain the routes of colonization taken by the volant fauna and freshwater fish. Caribbean geologic history does not preclude an origin by late Mesozoic vicariance for several possibly ancient groups, although an early Cenozoic arrival by dispersal also cannot be discounted. An integrative approach to historical biogeography is shown to be more insightful than the current trend in the field, cladistic biogeography, which places prime emphasis only on phylogenetic relationships.},

	abstract = {The total area of the West Indies is small, only 0.15{\%} of Earth's land area, but the region supports 3.0{\%} (180 species) of the world's amphibians and 6.3{\%} (520 species) of the world's known reptiles. Nearly all species are endemic to a single island or island bank. Rates of discovery are high indicating that many more species remain to be found. Most or all of the groups arrived at different times during the Cenozoic Era (the last 65 million years) by dispersal over water, principally on flotsam from South America. This resulted in a filtered fauna that has relatively few higher-level groups. The vacant niches led to unusually large radiations (mega-radiations) of species, explaining the presence of extremes in ecology and morphology among the species. The conservation status of only the amphibians has been assessed comprehensively, and 84{\%} of those species are considered threatened. The reptiles may be similarly threatened. Species are threatened mostly because they have small distributions and habitat destruction is continuing. Across the region only about 10{\%} of primary forests remain, and some countries (e.g., Haiti) with high levels of faunal diversity have no original forests. Some species that have disappeared for decades are possibly extinct, while others face extinction soon from habitat destruction. Efforts to curb deforestation and to save targeted species through breeding programs are helping, but the continued survival of many West Indian amphibians and reptiles is tenuous. Measures having immediate impact, such as salaries and logistical support for park guards, are needed immediately. Greater facilitation of biotic surveys and inventories, through relaxing of permitting restrictions, also is needed to better understand the diversity that exists and to focus conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {Inbreeding depression has been a topic of interest in recent years from a number of perspectives, particularly in the captive breeding of endangered species. Generally, the goal of captive breeding is to avoid the detrimental effects of inbreeding depression and to retain genetic variation for future adaptation. However, an important component of another suggested approach to captive breeding is to purge rapidly the population of its genetic load so that its long-term fitness is not compromised. I have examined the effectiveness of purging the genetic load by documenting both the reduction in inbreeding depression and the increase of the probability of extinction when there is continuous full-sib mating. When the genetic load is the result of lethals, the inbreeding depression is quickly purged without a high probability of extinction, except when the total genetic load is high. On the other hand, if the load is due to detrimentals of relatively small effect, the genetic load becomes fixed, the mean fitness is reduced, and the probability of extinction may be greatly increased. In other words, the success of such a programme to purge genetic load without an increase in the probability of extinction is highly dependent upon the genetic basis of inbreeding depression, information that is not readily available for most species.},

	abstract = {In many instances, there are large sex differences in mutation rates, recombination rates, selection, rates of gene flow, and genetic drift. Mutation rates are often higher in males, a difference that has been estimated both directly and indirectly. The higher male mutation rate appears related to the larger number of cell divisions in male lineages but mutation rates also appear gene- and organism-specific. When there is recombination in only one sex, it is always the homogametic sex. When there is recombination in both sexes, females often have higher recombination but there are many exceptions. There are a number of hypotheses to explain the sex differences in recombination. Sex-specific differences in selection may result in stable polymorphisms or for sex chromosomes, faster evolutionary change. In addition, sex-dependent selection may result in antagonistic pleiotropy or sexually antagonistic genes. There are many examples of sex-specific differences in gene flow (dispersal) and a number of adaptive explanations for these differences. The overall effective population size (genetic drift) is dominated by the lower sex-specific effective population size. The mean of the mutation, recombination, and gene flow rates over the two sexes can be used in a population genetics context unless there are sex-specific differences in selection or genetic drift. Sex-specific differences in these evolutionary factors appear to be unrelated to each other. The evolutionary explanations for sex-specific differences for each factor are multifaceted and, in addition, explanations may include chance, nonadaptive differences, or mechanistic, nonevolutionary factors.},

	abstract = {Inbreeding depression is of major concern in the management and con- servation of endangered species. Inbreeding appears universally to reduce fitness, but its magnitude and specific effects are highlyvariable because they depend onthe genetic constitution of the species or populations and on how these genotypes interact with the environment. Recent natural experiments are consistent with greater inbreeding depression in more stressful environments. In small populations of randomly mating individuals, such as are characteristic of many endangered species, all individuals may suffer from inbreeding depression because of the cumulative effects of genetic drift that decrease the fitness of all individuals in the population. In three recent cases, intro- ductions into populations with low fitness appeared to restore fitness to levels similar to those before the effects of genetic drift. Inbreeding depression may potentially be reduced, or purged, by breeding related individuals. However, the Speke's gazelle example, often cited as a demonstration of reduction of inbreeding depression, appears to be the result of a temporal change in fitness in inbred individuals and not a reduction in inbreeding depression.},

Recent estimates suggest that its impact on individual fitness is even greater than previously thought. Genomic information is contributing to its detection and can enlighten important aspects of its genetic architecture. In natural populations, purging and genetic rescue mitigate fitness decline during inbreeding periods, and might be critical to population survival, thus, both mechanisms should be considered when assessing extinction risks. However, deliberate purging and genetic rescue involve considerable risk in the short and medium term, so that neither appears to be a panacea against high inbreeding depression.},

Genetic markers can provide strong evidence that populations are closed (self-recruiting) because genetic differentiation is highly sensitive to migration. However, inferences based on genetic data must necessarily be based on models that make assumptions concerning inheritance, selective neutrality of markers, and equilibrium between genetic drift, migration, and mutation. We briefly introduce the types of genetic markers that can be used to infer demographic connections between populations and the forces causing evolutionary changes in these markers, and then we outline six patterns revealed by geographic surveys of genetic markers in marine species. Four of these patterns represent the possible combinations of high or low migration rates and large or small effective population sizes; two others are due to history and natural selection. Future genetic surveys should include more detailed spatial and temporal sampling and employ analyses of DNA sequence data that can reveal the signatures of natural selection and historical changes.},

Both survival and growth of juveniles showed inbreeding depression under laboratory conditions. The same fitness components were monitored with mature snails either kept under laboratory conditions or released at a natural site and analysed using capture-mark-recapture models. Genetic composition of both samples was similar. Inbreeding depression on survival was highest in the laboratory while strong outbreeding depression was revealed in the field. Thus inbreeding depression may not be always higher under natural conditions, at the opposite of what is commonly assumed. We suggest that inbreeding depression is dependent on metabolic requirements imposed by the environment. Other evidences showing that inbreeding depression is environment-dependent are reviewed. We conclude that genetic models should include both genetic and environmental variance in inbreeding depression for studying mating system evolution.},

Using a simple, deterministic model of population growth, we compared analytically exact solutions predicting abundance of consumers in two isolated patches with abundance of consumers in a single large patch where the carrying capacity of the large patch is the sum of the carrying capacities of the isolated ones. For the deterministic model, the effect of fragmentation was to slow the rate of population growth in the fragmented habitat relative to the intact one. We also analyzed a stochastic version of the model to examine the effect of fragmentation on population abundance when resources vary randomly in time. For the stochastic model, the effect of fragmentation was to reduce population abundance. We proved in closed-form, that for a non-equilibrium population exhibiting logistic population growth, fragmentation will reduce population size even when the total carrying capacity is not affected by fragmentation. We provide a theoretical basis for the prediction that habitat fragmentation amplifies the effect of habitat loss on the abundance of mobile organisms.},

Leading edge colonization during a rapid expansion would be leptokurtic and lead to homozygosity and spatial assortment of genomes. In Europe and North America, ice age contractions were into southern refugia, which would promote genome reorganization.

	abstract = {An appreciation of the scale and frequency of climatic oscillations in the past few million years is modifying our views on how evolution proceeds. Such major events caused extinction and repeated changes in the ranges of those taxa that survived. Their spatial effects depend on latitude and topography, with extensive extinction and recolonization in higher latitudes and altitudinal shifts and complex refugia nearer the tropics. The associated population dynamics varied with life history and geography, and the present genetic constitution of the populations and species carry attenuated signals of these past dynamics. Phylogeographic studies with DNA have burgeoned recently and studies are reviewed from the arctic, temperate and tropical regions, seeking commonalities of cause in the resulting genetic patterns. Arctic species show distinct shallow genetic clades with common geographical boundaries. Thus Beringia is distinct phylogeographically, but its role as a refugial source is complex. Arctic taxa do not show the common genetic pattern of southern richness and northern purity in north-temperate species. Temperate refugial regions in Europe and North America show relatively deep DNA divergence for many taxa, indicating their presence over several Ice Ages, and suggesting a mode of speciation by repeated allopatry. DNA evidence indicates temperate species in Europe had different patterns of postglacial colonization across the same area and different ones in previous oscillations, whereas the northwest region of North America was colonized from the north, east and south. Tropical montane regions contain deeply diverged lineages, often in a relatively small geographical area, suggesting their survival there from the Pliocene. Our poor understanding of refugial biodiversity would benefit from further combined fossil and genetic studies.},

	abstract = {Population structure is the result of both present processes and past history. Molecular markers are proving of great value in describing the former, and it is important to similarly determine the latter in order to understand their respective contributions. The study of palaeo-climates has also advanced significantly, and in particular that of the Pleistocene ice ages, which modified species ranges considerably. The last ice age and rapid post-glacial colonization of Europe is summarized. Possible population genetic consequences of expansion northward from southern refugia, and those of remaining in these mountainous regions are discussed. A series of recent case studies are detailed where DNA sequence information has been used to describe species genetic variation and subdivision across Europe. These include a grasshopper, the hedgehog, oak trees, the common beech, the black alder, the brown bear, newts, shrews, water vole, silver fir and house mice. These molecular data confirm southern peninsulas of Europe as major ice age refugia, and in most cases demonstrate that genetically distinct taxa emerged from them. They can thus define genomic differences and so gready augment previous fossil data. The refugial genomes contributed differently in various species to die re-colonization of Europe, with three broad patterns described as paradigms--`grasshopper', `hedgehog' and `bear'. These different expansion patterns produced clusters of hybrid zones where they made contact, and it is argued that many species genomes may be further cryptically subdivided. A reduction in diversity from southern to northern Europe in the extent of allelic variation and species subdivision is seen; this is attributed to rapid expansion northward and the varied topography of southern refugia allowing populations to diverge through several ice ages. The differences in DNA sequence indicate that some species have been diverging in refugial regions for a few ice ages at most, whilst distinct lineages in other species suggest much more ancient separation.},

	abstract = {The genetic study of diverging, closely related populations is required for basic questions on demography and speciation, as well as for biodiversity and conservation research. However, it is often unclear whether divergence is due simply to separation or whether populations have also experienced gene flow. These questions can be addressed with a full model of population separation with gene flow, by applying a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for estimating the posterior probability distribution of model parameters. We have generalized this method and made it applicable to data from multiple unlinked loci. These loci can vary in their modes of inheritance, and inheritance scalars can be implemented either as constants or as parameters to be estimated. By treating inheritance scalars as parameters it is also possible to address variation among loci in the impact via linkage of recurrent selective sweeps or background selection. These methods are applied to a large multilocus data set from Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. The species are estimated to have diverged approximately 500,000 years ago. Several loci have nonzero estimates of gene flow since the initial separation of the species, with considerable variation in gene flow estimates among loci, in both directions between the species.},

However, it can be difficult to determine whether shared polymorphisms are the result of gene flow, the result of the persistence of variation in both populations since the time of common ancestry, or both of these factors. We have developed an empirical protocol for using loci that include unique nuclear DNA sequence haplotypes together with linked microsatellites or short tandem repeats (STRs). These 'HapSTRs' offer the potentially high resolution associated with the high mutation rate of STRs, together with the advantages of low homoplasy of unique sequence DNA. We also describe a new procedure for estimating the likelihood of HapSTR data under an Isolation with Migration model. An example using Cichlid fishes from Lake Malawi is described. The analysis suggests that the species have been exchanging genes since the time they began to diverge.},

	abstract = {Magnetic and bathymetric data from the eastern Pacific have been analyzed and a model for the evolution of the Galapagos region developed. The Farallon plate appears to have broken apart along a pre-existing Pacific-Farallon fracture zone, possibly the Marquesas fracture zone, at about 25 m.y. B.P. to form the Cocos and Nazca plates. This break is marked on the Nazca plate topographically by the Grijalva scarp and magnetically by a rough-smooth boundary coincident with the scarp. The oldest Cocos-Nazca magnetic anomalies parallel this boundary, implying that the early Cocos-Nazca spreading center trended east-northeast. This system soon reorganized into an approximately east-west rise-north-south transform configuration, which has persisted until the present, and the Pacific-Cocos-Nazca triple junction has since migrated north from its original location near lat 5$\,^{\circ}$S. If correct, the combination of these simple geometric constraints produced the "enigmatic" east-trending anomalies south of the Carnegie Ridge. The axes of the Cocos-Nazca spreading center and the Carnegie Ridge are essentially parallel; this can lead to paradoxical conclusions about interpretation of the Cocos and Carnegie Ridges as hotspot tracks. Hey and others (1977) have shown that recent accretion on the Cocos-Nazca spreading center has been asymmetric, resulting at least in part from small discrete jumps of the rise axis. I show here that the geometric objections to both the "hot-spot" and "ancestral-ridge" hypotheses on the origin of the Cocos and Carnegie Ridges can be resolved with an asymmetric-accretion model. However, all forms of the ancestral-ridge hypothesis encounter more severe geometric difficulties, and these results support the hotspot hypothesis. After further elaboration of the hotspot hypothesis by Johnson and Lowrie (1972) and Hey and others (1973), Sclater and Klitgord (1973) examined both the hotspot and ancestral-ridge hypotheses and decided that both should be rejected, concluding that the Cocos and Carnegie Ridges "are not tectonically related" (p. 6973). The difficulty in the Galapagos area arises primarily because the older magnetic anomalies have proven extremely difficult to correlate, surprisingly so considering the high data density and the ease with which the very young anomalies are correlated. An important problem is the reason for this difficulty in correlating older anomalies - either clearly recognizable anomalies were never formed here, or some mec{\ldots}},

	abstract = {Some species are expanding their ranges polewards during current climate warming. However, anthropogenic fragmentation of suitable habitat is affecting expansion rates and here we investigate interactions between range expansion, habitat fragmentation and genetic diversity. We examined three closely related Satyrinae butterflies, which differ in their habitat associations, from six sites along a transect in England from distribution core to expanding range margin. There was a significant decline in allozyme variation towards an expanding range margin in Pararge aegeria, which has the most restricted habitat availability, but not in Pyronia tithonus whose habitat is more widely available, or in a non-expanding 'control species' (Maniola jurtina). Moreover, data from another transect in Scotland indicated that declines in genetic diversity in P. aegeria were evident only on the transect in England, which had greater habitat fragmentation. Our results indicate that fragmentation of breeding habitats leads to more severe founder events during colonization, resulting in reduced diversity in marginal populations in more specialist species. The continued widespread loss of suitable habitats in the future may increase the likelihood of loss of genetic diversity in expanding species, which may affect whether or not species can adapt to future environmental change.},

The tighter the linkage and the greater the selection, then the later is the maximum in the mean ofD (2) reached, and the larger its value. The correlation of gene frequencies,r, in the population of gametes within segregating lines was also studied.

Iguanas on visited islands were less wary of human presence than those on non-visited islands. Unlike on non-visited islands, iguanas on beaches where they were fed by tourists consumed people-influenced items including trash (e.g., styrofoam, aluminum foil), non-native fruits and vegetables (e.g., grapes, tomatoes), and sand. Non-native fruits provided a higher liquid content diet than did native vegetation, which, when mixed with sand, created cement-like feces that may have medical consequences. Tourism has encouraged an increase in these iguana populations, but it is now clear that negative impacts, such as loss of wariness and dietary shifts shown in this study as well as possible demographic consequences, also are occurring.

	abstract = {Evidences from fossil records and genetic research suggest that the arboreal refugia were not restricted to Southern Europe and in particular to the Mediterranean peninsulas during the full-glacials. Fossil pollen data and macrofossil remains indicate that several tree species have survived also at the Southern edge of the cold-dry steppe-tundra area in Central and Eastern Europe. Recent results of surveys on the Late Pleistocene Mammalian fauna clearly contradict to the  tree-less tundra  models for Europe North of the transverse mountain ranges of the Pyrenees, Alps and Carpathians. It was pointed out that the carrying capacity to feed the herds of large herbivores demands a rather productive environment. The presence of Northern temperate refugia is also supported by the  non-analogue  assemblages of small mammals discovered from the Late Pleistocene of unglaci-ated areas of Eastern Central Europe. The assembly of species today typifying the tundra, steppe and semi-desert habitats seems to include also species from deciduous woodland. Extra-Mediterranean core areas were identified also in widely dispersed cold-tolerant frogs and reptiles. Some of their core areas had been at least near the Carpathians and/or marginal areas of the Carpathian Basin. The close faunal connections of the Carpathians suggest the existence of highly dynamic contacts and exchanges with mountains of the Balkan Peninsula during the climatic fluctuations of the Upper Pleistocene. The Eastern and Southern Carpathians, together with the mountains of Western Transylvania, can be considered as core areas of survival and autochtonous evolution in some invertebrate groups with limited mobility. The post-glacial re-population of the Carpathian Basin from different directions has been supported by Illyrian versus Dacian vicarious pairs of sister species/subspecies. In mobile insect groups, peripherically isolated sibling species/subspecies have only been evolved, which display manifold biogeographic connections, e.g. to the Balkan Peninsula, Asia Minor or Southern Russia. The organisation of community-complexes of the Pannonian forest-steppe connected by habitat ecotones resulted in the overlap of several different faunal types, e.g. Mediterranean, Balkanic, Siberian, Ponto-Caspian, Ponto-Pannonian, Turano-Eremic and Xeromontane elements.},

Although previous studies have shown that increased sex and recombination can evolve in the presence of host-parasite interactions (the 'Red Queen hypothesis' for sex), many of these studies have assumed that multiple loci mediate infection vs. resistance. Data suggest, however, that a major locus is typically involved in antigen presentation and recognition. Here, we explore a model where only one locus mediates host-parasite interactions, but a second locus is subject to directional selection. Even though the effects of these genes on fitness are independent, we show that increased rates of sex and recombination are favoured at a modifier gene that alters the rate of genetic mixing. This result occurs because of selective interference in finite populations (the 'Hill-Robertson effect'), which also favours sex. These results suggest that the Red Queen hypothesis may help to explain the evolution of sex by contributing a form of persistent selection, which interferes with directional selection at other loci and thereby favours sex and recombination.},

	abstract = {The effective population size (N(e)) is proportional to the loss of genetic diversity and the rate of inbreeding, and its accurate estimation is crucial for the monitoring of small populations. Here, we integrate temporal studies of the gecko Oedura reticulata, to compare genetic and demographic estimators of N(e). Because geckos have overlapping generations, our goal was to demographically estimate N(bI), the inbreeding effective number of breeders and to calculate the N(bI)/N(a) ratio (N(a) =number of adults) for four populations. Demographically estimated N(bI) ranged from 1 to 65 individuals. The mean reduction in the effective number of breeders relative to census size (N(bI)/N(a)) was 0.1 to 1.1. We identified the variance in reproductive success as the most important variable contributing to reduction of this ratio. We used four methods to estimate the genetic based inbreeding effective number of breeders N(bI(gen)) and the variance effective populations size N(eV(gen)) estimates from the genotype data. Two of these methods - a temporal moment-based (MBT) and a likelihood-based approach (TM3) require at least two samples in time, while the other two were single-sample estimators - the linkage disequilibrium method with bias correction LDNe and the program ONeSAMP. The genetic based estimates were fairly similar across methods and also similar to the demographic estimates excluding those estimates, in which upper confidence interval boundaries were uninformative. For example, LDNe and ONeSAMP estimates ranged from 14-55 and 24-48 individuals, respectively. However, temporal methods suffered from a large variation in confidence intervals and concerns about the prior information. We conclude that the single-sample estimators are an acceptable short-cut to estimate N(bI) for species such as geckos and will be of great importance for the monitoring of species in fragmented landscapes.},

	abstract = {Microsatellite genotyping errors will be present in all but the smallest data sets and have the potential to undermine the conclusions of most downstream analyses. Despite this, little rigorous effort has been made to quantify the size of the problem and to identify the commonest sources of error. Here, we use a large data set comprising almost 2000 Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella genotyped at nine hypervariable microsatellite loci to explore error detection methods, common sources of error and the consequences of errors on paternal exclusion. We found good concordance among a range of contrasting approaches to error-rate estimation, our range being 0.0013 to 0.0074 per single locus PCR (polymerase chain reaction). The best approach probably involves blind repeat-genotyping, but this is also the most labour-intensive. We show that several other approaches are also effective at detecting errors, although the most convenient alternative, namely mother-offspring comparisons, yielded the lowest estimate of the error rate. In total, we found 75 errors, emphasizing their ubiquitous presence. The most common errors involved the misinterpretation of allele banding patterns (n = 60, 80{\%}) and of these, over a third (n = 22, 36.7{\%}) were due to confusion between homozygote and adjacent allele heterozygote genotypes. A specific test for whether a data set contains the expected number of adjacent allele heterozygotes could provide a useful tool with which workers can assess the likely size of the problem. Error rates are also positively correlated with both locus polymorphism and product size, again indicating aspects where extra effort at error reduction should be directed. Finally, we conducted simulations to explore the potential impact of genotyping errors on paternity exclusion. Error rates as low as 0.01 per allele resulted in a rate of false paternity exclusion exceeding 20{\%}. Errors also led to reduced estimates of male reproductive skew and increases in the numbers of pups that matched more than one candidate male. Because even modest error rates can be strongly influential, we recommend that error rates should be routinely published and that researchers make an attempt to calculate how robust their analyses are to errors.},

	abstract = {Proxy measures of genome-wide heterozygosity based on approximately 10 microsatellites have been used to uncover heterozygosity fitness correlations (HFCs) for a wealth of important fitness traits in natural populations. However, effect sizes are typically very small and the underlying mechanisms remain contentious, as a handful of markers usually provides little power to detect inbreeding. We therefore used restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to accurately estimate genome-wide heterozygosity, an approach transferrable to any organism. As a proof of concept, we first RAD sequenced oldfield mice (Peromyscus polionotus) from a known pedigree, finding strong concordance between the inbreeding coefficient and heterozygosity measured at 13,198 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). When applied to a natural population of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina), a weak HFC for parasite infection based on 27 microsatellites strengthened considerably with 14,585 SNPs, the deviance explained by heterozygosity increasing almost fivefold to a remarkable 49{\%}. These findings arguably provide the strongest evidence to date of an HFC being due to inbreeding depression in a natural population lacking a pedigree. They also suggest that under some circumstances heterozygosity may explain far more variation in fitness than previously envisaged.},

	abstract = {There is substantial evidence that environmental changes on a landscape level can have dramatic consequences for the species richness and structure of food webs as well as on trophic interactions within such food webs. Thus far, the consequences of environmental change, and particularly the effects of invasive species and the fragmentation and isolation of natural habitats, have most often been studied in a purely ecological context, with the main emphasis on the description of alterations in species abundance and diversity and trophic links within food webs. Here, we argue that the study of evolutionary processes that may be affected by such changes is urgently needed to enhance our understanding of the consequences of environmental change. This requires an approach that treats species as dynamic systems with plastic responses to change rather than as static entities. As such, phenotypic plasticity on an individual level and genotypic change as a population level response should be taken into account when studying the consequences of a changing world. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we report on recent advances in our understanding, identify some major gaps in our current knowledge, and point towards rewarding approaches to enhance our understanding of how environmental change alters trophic interactions and ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Population genomic studies are beginning to provide a more comprehensive view of dynamic genome-scale processes in evolution. Patterns of genomic architecture, such as genomic islands of increased divergence, may be important for adaptive population differentiation and speciation. We used next-generation sequencing data to examine the patterns of local and long-distance linkage disequilibrium (LD) across oceanic and freshwater populations of threespine stickleback, a useful model for studies of evolution and speciation. We looked for associations between LD and signatures of divergent selection, and assessed the role of recombination rate variation in generating LD patterns. As predicted under the traditional biogeographic model of unidirectional gene flow from ancestral oceanic to derived freshwater stickleback populations, we found extensive local and long-distance LD in fresh water. Surprisingly, oceanic populations showed similar patterns of elevated LD, notably between large genomic regions previously implicated in adaptation to fresh water. These results support an alternative biogeographic model for the stickleback radiation, one of a metapopulation with appreciable bi-directional gene flow combined with strong divergent selection between oceanic and freshwater populations. As predicted by theory, these processes can maintain LD within and among genomic islands of divergence. These findings suggest that the genomic architecture in oceanic stickleback populations may provide a mechanism for the rapid re-assembly and evolution of multi-locus genotypes in newly colonized freshwater habitats, and may help explain genetic mapping of parallel phenotypic variation to similar loci across independent freshwater populations.},

	abstract = {A systematic study of the chuckwallas (genus Sauromalus) is presented which combines a traditional monographic revision with a modern phylogenetic analysis. Included are a reassessment of alpha taxonomy and geographic variation, a hypothesis of evolutionary relationships, a reevaluation of the relationships of Sauromalus to other iguanid genera, and an examination of trends in morphology, biogeography, and natural history within Sauromalus in light of the recovered phvlogenv. Due to difficulties in diagnosing many of the chuckwalla species, geographically isolated populations were selected as operational taxonomic units (OTU's). This resulted in the designation of 31 insular and eight continental OTU's. These OTL's were included in a larger analysis with the other 23 species within Iguanini (the clade of iguanids above Dipsosaurus, Armandisaurus†, and Brachylophus). A phylogenetic analysis was performed using 142 characters of scalation, coloration, soft tissues, and osteology; 93 of which came directly or were modified from the previous studies of de Queiroz (1987a,b) and Norell and de Queiroz (1991). Two analyses were performed, each using different coding schemes for polymorphic characters. The first used the baseline method (polymorphisms coded as "0,1") and the second used the frequency bin method (Wiens, 1993, 1995). The monophyly of all currently recognized iguanid genera is supported in both analyses. Intergeneric relationships are resolved in the strict consensus tree using the frequency bin method (Ctenoaaura ((Cyclura + Iguana) + (Sauramalus (Amblyrhynchus + Conolophus) and only partially resolved using the baseline method. Interspecific relationships are proposed for the genera Cyclura, Ctenosaura, and Sauromalus. Relationships among the OTU's in Sauromalus are partly resolved using the frequency bin method, although some nodes are weakly supported. The results from the baseline method are consistent with the more strongly supported nodes from the frequency bin method. The strict consensus trees suggest the recognition of four insular endemics, hispidus, klauberi, slevini, and varius, while the OTU's recognized under obesus, australis, and ater yield an unresolved polytomy. Because the relationships between the obesus, australis, and ater OTU's are unresolved and these taxa cannot be diagnosed from each other using fixed character differences, obesus and australis are synonymized with ater.

Maximizing the efficiency of a single cilium leads to curly, often symmetric, and somewhat counterintuitive patterns. However, when looking at a densely ciliated surface, the optimal patterns become remarkably similar to what is observed in microorganisms like Paramecium. The optimal beating pattern then consists of a fast effective stroke and a slow sweeping recovery stroke. Metachronal coordination is essential for efficient pumping and the highest efficiency is achieved with antiplectic waves. Efficiency also increases with an increasing density of cilia up to the point where crowding becomes a problem. We finally relate the pumping efficiency of cilia to the swimming efficiency of a spherical microorganism and show that the experimentally estimated efficiency of Paramecium is surprisingly close to the theoretically possible optimum.},

These fungal cupping erosions emit a characteristic fluorescent orange-yellow color when the wing membrane is transilluminated with 385 nm UV light. The purpose of this study was to create and validate the R package, countcolors, for quantifying the distinct orange--yellow ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence in bat-wing membrane lesions caused by P. destructans. Validation of countcolors was completed by first quantifying the percent area of 20, 2.5 cm 2 images. These generated images were of two known pixel colors ranging from 0{\%} to 100{\%} of the pixels. The countcolors package accurately measured the known proportion of a given color in each image. Next, 40, 2.5 cm 2 sections of UV transilluminated photographs of little brown bat ( Myotis lucifugus) wings were given to a single evaluator. The area of fluorescence was both manually measured and calculated using image analysis software and quantified with countcolors. There was good agreement between the two methods (Pearson's correlation=0.915); however, the manual use of imaging software showed a consistent negative bias. Reproducibility of the analysis methods was tested by providing the same images to naive evaluators who previously never used the software; no significant difference ( P=0.099) was found among evaluators. Using the R package countcolors takes less time than does manually measuring the fluorescence in image analysis software, and our results showed that countcolors can improve the accuracy when quantifying the area of P. destructans infection in bat wing-membranes.},

	abstract = {Allopatric speciation results from geographic isolation between populations. In the absence of gene flow, reproductive isolation arises gradually and incidentally as a result of mutation, genetic drift and the indirect effects of natural selection driving local adaptation. In contrast, speciation by reinforcement is driven directly by natural selection against maladaptive hybridization. This gives individuals that choose the traits of their own lineage greater fitness, potentially leading to rapid speciation between the lineages. Reinforcing natural selection on a population of one of the lineages in a mosaic contact zone could also result in divergence of the population from the allopatric range of its own lineage outside the zone. Here we test this with molecular data, experimental crosses, field measurements and mate choice experiments in a mosaic contact zone between two lineages of a rainforest frog. We show that reinforcing natural selection has resulted in significant premating isolation of a population in the contact zone not only from the other lineage but also, incidentally, from the closely related main range of its own lineage. Thus we show the potential for reinforcement to drive rapid allopatric speciation. {\textcopyright} 2005 Nature Publishing Group.},

@article{Houle1998,
	abstract = {Recent work has called attention to large differences among traits in the amount of standardized genetic variance they possess. There are four general factors which could play a role in causing this variation: mutation, elimination of deleterious variation, selection of favorable alleles, and balancing selection. Three factors could directly influence the mutational variability of traits: canalization, the mutational target size, and the timing of trait expression. Here I carry out simple tests of the importance of some of these factors using data from Drosophila melanogaster. I compiled information from the literature on the mutational and standing genetic variances in outbred populations, inferred the relative mutational target size of each trait, its a timing of expression, and used models of life history to calculate fitness sensitivities for each trait. Mutational variation seems to play an important role, as it is highly correlated with standing variance. The target size hypothesis was supported by a significant correlation between mutational variance and inferred target size. There was also a significant relationship between the timing of trait expression and mutational variance. These hypotheses are confounded by a correlation between timing and target size. The elimination and canalization hypotheses were not supported by these data, suggesting that they play a quantitatively less important role in determining overall variances. Additional information concerning the pleiotropic consequences of mutations would help to validate the fitness sensitivities used to test the elimination and canalization hypotheses.},

@article{Houle1996,
	abstract = {We have reviewed the available data on VM, the amount of genetic variation in phenotypic traits produced each generation by mutation. We use these data to make several qualitative tests of the mutation-selection balance hypothesis for the maintenance of genetic variance (MSB). To compare VM values, we use three dimensionless quantities: mutational heritability, VM/VE, the mutational coefficient of variation, CVM; and the ratio of the standing genetic variance to VM, VC/VM. Since genetic coefficients of variation for life history traits are larger than those for morphological traits, we predict that under MSB, life history traits should also have larger CVM. This is confirmed; life history traits have a median CVM value more than six times higher than that for morphological traits. VC/VM approximates the persistence time of mutations under MSB in an infinite population. In order for MSB to hold, VC/VM must be small, substantially less than 1000, and life history traits should have smaller values than morphological traits. VC/VM averages about 50 generations for life history traits and 100 generations for morphological traits. These observations are all consistent with the predictions of a mutation-selection balance model.},

	abstract = {Lizards of the genus Ameiva (Teiidae) are found throughout the West Indies and in Central and South America. We investigated their phylogenetic relationships and biogeography with new sequences from portions of the 12S and 16S mitochondrial rRNA genes of sixteen West Indian species and three Central and South American species. The West Indian species form a monophyletic group that diverged from the mainland species approximately 25-30 million years ago. The most likely origin of this clade was from South America by dispersal on flotsam. Within the West Indies, species groupings correspond more closely to geography than morphology, revealing several cases of convergence. Four species groups are proposed for the West Indian species: the auberi Group (auberi and dorsalis) occurs on Cuba, Jamaica, and the Bahamas; the exsul Group (exsul, polops, and wetmorei) in the Puerto Rico region; the lineolata Group (chrysolaema, lineolata, maynardi, and A. taeniura) on Hispaniola, Navassa, and the Bahamas; and the plei Group (cinera- cea, corax, corvina, erythrocephala, fuscata, griswoldi, major, plei, and pluvianotata) is in the Lesser Antilles. Sequence analyses indicate that A. leberi of Hispaniola is a junior synonym of A. chrysolaema.},

However, these arguments have downplayed the potentially negative consequences of outbreeding depression once mixed provenances interbreed. In this study, we compared intraspecific F1 hybrid performance and molecular marker differentiation among four populations of Stylidium hispidum, a species endemic to Southwestern Australia. Multivariate ordination of 134 AFLP markers analyzed genetic structure and detected two clusters of paired sites that diverged significantly for marker variation along a latitudinal boundary. To test for outbreeding depression and to determine the consequences of molecular population divergence for hybrid fitness, we conducted controlled pollinations and studied germination and survival for three cross categories (within-population crosses, short- and long-distance F1 hybrids) for paired sites distributed within and between the two genetically differentiated regions. We found evidence of outbreeding depression in long-distance hybrids (111-124 km), and inbreeding depression among progeny of within-population crosses, relative to short-distance (3-10 km) hybrids, suggesting an intermediate optimal outcrossing distance in this species. These results are discussed in light of the evolutionary consequences of mixing seed sources for biodiversity restoration.},

	abstract = {The evolutionary history of a set of taxa is usually represented by a phylogenetic tree, and this model has greatly facilitated the discussion and testing of hypotheses. However, it is well known that more complex evolutionary scenarios are poorly described by such models. Further, even when evolution proceeds in a tree-like manner, analysis of the data may not be best served by using methods that enforce a tree structure but rather by a richer visualization of the data to evaluate its properties, at least as an essential first step. Thus, phylogenetic networks should be employed when reticulate events such as hybridization, horizontal gene transfer, recombination, or gene duplication and loss are believed to be involved, and, even in the absence of such events, phylogenetic networks have a useful role to play. This article reviews the terminology used for phylogenetic networks and covers both split networks and reticulate networks, how they are defined, and how they can be interpreted. Additionally, the article outlines the beginnings of a comprehensive statistical framework for applying split network methods. We show how split networks can represent confidence sets of trees and introduce a conservative statistical test for whether the conflicting signal in a network is treelike. Finally, this article describes a new program, SplitsTree4, an interactive and comprehensive tool for inferring different types of phylogenetic networks from sequences, distances, and trees. {\textcopyright} The Author 2005.

	abstract = {One of the simplest evolutionary models has molecular sequences evolving from a common ancestor down a bifurcating phylogenetic tree, experiencing point-mutations along the way. However, empirical analyses of different genes indicate that the evolution of genomes is often more complex than can be represented by such a model. Thus, the following problem is of significant interest in molecular evolution: Given a set of molecular sequences, compute a reticulate network that explains the data using a minimal number of reticulations. This paper makes four contributions toward solving this problem. First, it shows that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the tangles in a reticulate network, the connected components of the associated incompatibility graph and the netted components of the associated splits graph. Second, it provides an algorithm that computes a most parsimonious reticulate network in polynomial time, if the reticulations contained in any tangle have a certain overlapping property, and if the number of reticulations contained in any given tangle is bounded by a constant. Third, an algorithm for drawing reticulate networks is described and a robust and flexible implementation of the algorithms is provided. Fourth, the paper presents a statistical test for distinguishing between reticulations due to hybridization, and ones due to other events such as lineage sorting or tree-estimation error. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Ib{\'{a}}{\~{n}}ez et al. Background: Chemical signals are widely used in the animal kingdom, enabling communication in various social contexts, including mate selection and the establishment of dominance. Femoral glands, which produce and release waxy secretions into the environment, are organs of central importance in lizard chemical communication. The Gal{\'{a}}pagos marine iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) is a squamate reptile wit h a lek-mating system. Although the lekking behaviour of marine iguanas has been well-studied, their potential for sexual communication via chemical cues has not yet been investigated. Here we describe the diversity of the lipophilic fraction of males' femoral gland secretions among 11 island populations of marine iguanas, and compare it with the composition of its sister species, the Gal{\'{a}}pagos land iguana (Conolophus subcristatus). We also conducted behavioural observations in marine iguana territorial males in order to explore the possible function of these substances in the context of male dominance in leks. Methods: Femoral secretions were analysed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and chromatography with a flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) in order to characterise the lipophilic composition. To understand the potential role of femoral secretions in marine iguana intraspecific communication, territorial males were sampled for their femoral glands and monitored to record their head bob rate-a territorial display behaviour in males-as well as the number of females present in their leks. Results: We found that the gland secretions were composed of ten saturated and unsaturated carboxylic acids ranging in chain length between C16 and C24, as well as three sterols. Cholesterol was the main compound found. Intriguingly, land iguanas have a higher diversity of lipophilic compounds, with structural group of lipids (i.e. aldehydes) entirely absent in marine iguanas; overall the chemical signals of both species were strongly differentiated. Lipid profiles also differed among populations of marine iguanas from different islands, with some islands demonstrating a high diversity of lipophilic compounds (i.e. full spectra of compounds), and others lacking one or more compounds. Among the compounds most frequently found missing were 11- and 13-eicosenoic acids. Gland secretions of males with a better body condition and with a higher dominance status (i.e. those accompanied by females and with higher head bob display) were proportionately richer in C20-unsaturated fatty acids (11-eicosenoic acid). Discussion: Land and marine iguanas strongly diverged in their chemical composition of the femoral glands likely due to ecological differences between both species. Despite that marine iguana populations varied in their femoral gland composition that was not related to their genetic structure. Our results indicated that 11-eicosenoic acid may play an important role in intraspecific chemical communication in marine iguanas.},

	abstract = {Multilocus phylogenies can be used to infer the species tree of a group of closely related species. In species trees, the nodes represent the actual separation between species, thus providing essential information about their evolutionary history. In addition, multilocus phylogenies can help in analyses of species delimitation, gene flow and genetic differentiation within species. However, few adequate markers are available for such studies. In order to develop nuclear markers that can be useful in multilocus studies of mammals, we analyzed the mammalian genomes of human, chimpanzee, macaque, dog and cow. Rodents were excluded due to their unusual genomic features. Introns were extracted from the mammalian genomes because of their greater genetic variability and ease of amplification from the flanking exons. To an initial set of more than 10,000 one-to-one orthologous introns we applied several filters to select introns that belong to single-copy genes, show neutral evolutionary rates and have an adequate length for their amplification. This analysis led to a final list of 224 intron markers randomly distributed along the genome. To experimentally test their validity, we amplified twelve of these introns in a panel of six mammalian species. The result was that seven of these introns gave rise to a PCR band of the expected size in all species. In addition, we sequenced these bands and analyzed the accumulation of substitutions in these introns in five pairs of closely related species. The results showed that the estimated genetic distances in the five species pairs was quite variable among introns and that this divergence cannot be directly predicted from the overall intron divergence in mammals. We have designed a new set of 224 nuclear introns with optimal features for the phylogeny of closely related mammalian species. A large proportion of the introns tested experimentally showed a perfect amplification and enough variability in most species, indicating that this marker set can be very helpful in multilocus phylogenetics of mammals. Due to the lower variability and stronger stochasticity of nuclear markers with respect to mitochondrial genes, studies should be designed to make use of several markers like the ones designed here.},

	abstract = {For a Wright-Fisher model with mutation whose population size fluctuates stochastically from generation to generation, a heterozygosity effective population size is defined by means of the equilibrium average heterozygosity of the population. It is shown that this effective population size is equal to the harmonic mean of population size if and only if the stochastic changes of population size are uncorrelated. The effective population size is larger (resp. smaller) than the harmonic mean when the stochastic changes of population size are positively (resp. negatively) autocorrelated. These results and those obtained so far for other stochastic models with fluctuating population size suggest that the property that effective population sizes are always larger than the harmonic mean under the fluctuation of population size holds only for continuous time models such as diffusion and coalescent models, whereas effective population sizes can be equal to or smaller than the harmonic mean for discrete time models.},

We mated wild-derived mice with siblings or first cousins and compared the resistance of their offspring to Salmonella infection with outbred controls under laboratory and seminatural conditions. In the laboratory, full-sib inbreeding reduced resistance to Salmonella and survivorship, whereas first-cousin inbreeding had no detectable effects. In competitive population enclosures, we found that first-cousin inbreeding reduced male fitness by 57{\%} in infected vs. only 34{\%} in noninfected control populations. Our study provides experimental evidence that inbreeding reduces resistance and ability to survive pathogenic infection, and moreover, it shows that even moderate inbreeding can cause significant fitness declines under naturalistic conditions of social stress, and especially with exposure to infectious agents.},

	abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

	abstract = {This paper* presents a series of detailed paleo- geographical analyses of the Caribbean region, beginning with the opening of the Caribbean ba- sin in the Middle Jurassic and running to the end of the Middle Miocene. Three intervals within the Cenozoic are given special treatment: Eocene--Ol- igocene transition (35--33 Ma), Late Oligocene (27--25 Ma), and early Middle Miocene (16--14 Ma). While land mammals and other terrestrial vertebrates may have occupied landmasses in the Caribbean basin at any time, according to the in- terpretation presented here the existing Greater Antillean islands, as islands, are no older than Middle Eocene. Earlier islands must have existed, but it is not likely that they remained as such (i.e., as subaerial entities) due to repeated transgres- sions, subsidence, and (not incidentally) the K/T bolide impact and associated mega-tsunamis. Ac- cordingly, we infer that the on-island lineages forming the existing (i.e., Quaternary) Antillean fauna must all be younger than Middle Eocene. The fossil record, although still very poor, is con- sistent with the observation that most land mam- mal lineages entered the Greater Antilles around the Eocene--Oligocene transition.},

	abstract = {Allen Cays Rock Iguanas (Cyclura cychlura inornata) are native to two small islets (Leaf and U Cay) in the north-central Bahamas. These populations were nearly extirpated in the early 1900s because of heavy hunting pressure (for food), but increased to a total of ca. 150 lizards in 1970, and now number over 500 (not including juveniles). Over the past several decades poaching has declined, but tourist visitation (including nearly daily supplemental feeding of iguanas) has increased. To examine human impacts on the demography of these iguanas, survival, population growth rates, and population sizes for subadult and adult ({\textgreater}25 cm snout-vent length) males and females on the two cays were estimated based on mark-recapture data collected over a 25-year period (1980-2004). As predicted, annual survival probability was higher on U Cay (with less human visitation) than on Leaf Cay, was higher in females than in males (which are bolder), and exhibited a declining trend. Both populations more than doubled during this study, but population growth rates declined to near zero in recent years. These data reflect the importance of human impacts, but also suggest that the populations may be nearing carrying capacity. The rapid population growth observed on these cays, and that seen for several other translocated iguana populations, suggest that if unnatural causes of mortality are reduced or eliminated, island populations of iguanas are capable of rapid recovery. The inexpensive establishment of assurance colonies on undisturbed "islands" should be considered for any comprehensive management plan for endangered species of iguanas. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The nesting ecology of the Allen Cays rock iguana was studied on Leaf Cay and Southwest Allen's Cay (= U Cay) in the northern Exuma Islands, Bahamas, during 2001 and 2002. Mating occured in mid-May, and females migrated 30-173 m to potential nest sites in mid to late June. Females often abandoned initial attempts at digging nest burrows, and average time from initiation of the final burrow to completion of a covered nest was six days. At least some females completely buried themselves within the burrow during the final stages of burrow construction and oviposition. Females defended the burrow site during the entire time of construction, and most continued that defense for at least three to four weeks after nest completion. Nests were completed between mid-June and mid-July, but for unknown reasons timing was seven days earlier on U Cay than on Leaf Cay. Nest burrows averaged 149 cm in length and terminal nest chambers usually angled off the main burrow. Depth to the bottom of the egg chamber averaged 28 cm, and was inversely correlated with shadiness of the site, suggesting that females may select depths with preferred temperatures (mean, 31.4 C in this study). Overall, only about one in three females nested each year, although nesting frequency increased with female size such that the largest females usually nest annually. Nest fidelity was common, despite the potential for observer effects; seven of 13 two-year nesters placed nests within 0.7 m of that constructed the previous year. Nesting females averaged 32 cm snout-vent length (SVL) and 1336 g body mass, and larger, older females nested earlier than smaller, younger ones. Sexual maturity is reached at 26-27 cm SVL, about 750 g body mass, and twelve years of age (nearly twice as old as any previously studied lizard). Longevity of females apparently exceeds 40 years. Clutch size ranged from 1-10 eggs (mean 4.6) and was correlated with female body size and age. Eggs averaged 66 mm in length, 35 mm in width, and 49 g in mass. Egg mass was not correlated with female body size, although egg length was negatively correlated, and egg width was positively correlated with female size. The production of elongate eggs in the smaller females allowed them to invest the same total mass in each egg as a larger female, while being constrained by the limits of the pelvic opening. No trade-off existed between standardized clutch size versus egg size. Relative clutch mass (clutch mass/gravid female body mass X 100) averaged 16.5 and did not vary with female size or age. Hatching apparently occurs in late September and early October after about 80-85 days incubation, with emergence within just a few days. Hatchlings averaged 9.5 cm SVL and 33 g body mass. Survivorship to emergence was 78.9{\%}, and was inversely correlated with soil moisture. The reproductive ecology of other iguanids (sensu strictu) is reviewed for comparison with that of the Allen Cays rock iguana. Comparisons of these data with those available for other rock iguanas of the genus Cyclura suggest that colonization of smaller islands has produced reductions in adult female body size, clutch size, clutch mass, and relative clutch mass, but no change in egg or hatchling mass. Because this pattern is also demonstrated by a population of Cuban iguanas introduced to a small island only 40 years ago, it may primarily be a proximal response to decreased resource availability and/or physiological processability on small islands rather than an evolved response to reduced predation rates or other factors affecting survivorship.},

	abstract = {Secondary flightlessness has evolved independently many times in birds. Morphological changes in the pectoral girdle and flight feathers and changes in body size have been associated with the evolution of flightlessness, and it has also been suggested that flightless birds have relatively small brains. We therefore tested whether flightlessness is related to changes in relative brain size. Relative brain size was compared between volant and flightless species using both conventional statistics and modern comparative methods within nine taxonomic groups. No significant difference was found between flightless and volant species in six of these groups, regardless of whether body mass or tibiotarsal measurements were used as estimates of body size. Species with relatively smaller brains compared with their volant relatives were the great auk Pinguinus impennis, the kakapo Strigops habroptilus and some species of penguin. Thus, we found no evidence of a general correlation between the evolution of secondary flightlessness and the evolution of relatively small brains in birds. This suggests that neural requirements are not significantly different between flightless and volant species, although our methods may have overlooked subtle neurological changes that do not result in markedly different endocranial volumes.},

	abstract = {Homozygosity is a commonly used summary of allele-frequency distributions at polymorphic loci. Because high-frequency alleles contribute disproportionately to the homozygosity of a locus, it often occurs that most homozygotes are homozygous for the most frequent allele. To assess the relationship between homozygosity and the highest allele frequency at a locus, for a given homozygosity value, we determine the lower and upper bounds on the frequency of the most frequent allele. These bounds suggest tight constraints on the frequency of the most frequent allele as a function of homozygosity, differing by at most 14 and having an average difference of 23 - pi(2)/18 approximately 0.1184. The close connection between homozygosity and the frequency of the most frequent allele-which we illustrate using allele frequencies from human populations-has the consequence that when one of these two quantities is known, considerable information is available about the other quantity. This relationship also explains the similar performance of statistical tests of population-genetic models that rely on homozygosity and those that rely on the frequency of the most frequent allele, and it provides a basis for understanding the utility of extended homozygosity statistics in identifying haplotypes that have been elevated to high frequency as a result of positive selection.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Current Zoology.Animal species are delimited by reproductive isolation mechanisms (RIMs). Postzygotic RIMs are mainly products of genetic differences and thus their strength increases with elapsed divergence time. The relationship between postzygotic reproductive isolation and genetic divergence, however, differs considerably among major clades of vertebrates. We reviewed the available literature providing empirical evidence of natural and/or experimental hybridization between distinct species of lizards (squamates except snakes). We found that hybridization events are widely distributed among nearly all major lizard clades. The majority of research focuses on parthenogenetic species and/or polyploid hybrids in families Lacertidae, Teiidae and Gekkonidae. Homoploid bisexual hybrids are mainly reported within Lacertidae and Iguania groups. As a proxy of genetic divergence of the hybridizing taxa we adopted nucleotide sequence distance (HKY85) of mitochondrial cyt b gene. The upper limit of genetic divergence was similar with regard to both parthenogenetic and bisexual hybrids. Maximum values of these distances between hybridizing species of lizards approached 18{\%}‒21{\%}, which is comparable to or even exceeds the corresponding values reported for other principal clades of vertebrates. In spite of this, F1 hybrids are typically at least partially fertile in lizards and thus genetic introgression between highly divergent species is possible. The relationship between the genetic distance and hybrid fertility was not found.},

	abstract = {The ocelot Leopardus pardalis has become a conservation priority in the US as a result of severe population decline and loss of habitat during the 20th century. Only two small populations remain in this country. Their short-term viability is threatened by the disappearance of dense thornshrub communities, human-caused mortality and demographic stochasticity. The influence these factors have on ocelot persistence must be considered to develop effective conservation initiatives. We therefore examined neutral genetic diversity and connectivity among ocelots in the US and northeastern Mexico using 25 autosomal microsatellites and a 395-bp segment of the mitochondrial control region. Genetic variation was lowest in the population occurring on Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge, Texas (autosomal microsatellite HE=0.399 and mtDNA-haplotype diversity=0) and highest in northeastern Mexico (0.637 and 0.73, respectively), while intermediate on private lands in Willacy County, Texas (0.553 and 0.252, respectively). Significant genetic differentiation between the two Texas populations was observed, despite their close proximity (30 km). Both populations were also significantly divergent from northeastern Mexico. The absence of any detectable gene flow implies that the human modified landscape of the Lower Rio Grande Valley in southern Texas acts as a strong barrier to ocelot movement, disrupting metapopulation dynamics and contributing to loss of diversity. As a consequence, continued genetic erosion among the Texas populations is expected. The lack of movement through the fragmented landscape also suggests it is unlikely ocelots will recolonize unoccupied habitat patches along the Lower Rio Grande and the delta interior where agriculture and urban land uses predominate. The continued rapid development will exacerbate this problem. These factors threaten the persistence of the Texas populations and limit their recovery. Translocations are necessary to link ocelot populations in the US.},

	abstract = {Assessments of population genetic structure have become an increasing focus as they can provide valuable insight into patterns of migration and gene flow. STRUCTURE, the most highly cited of several clustering-based methods, was developed to provide robust estimates without the need for populations to be determined a priori. STRUCTURE introduces the problem of selecting the optimal number of clusters and as a result the $\Delta$K method was proposed to assist in the identification of the `true' number of clusters. In our review of 1,264 studies using STRUCTURE to explore population subdivision, studies that used $\Delta$K were more likely to identify K=2 (54{\%}, 443/822) than studies that did not use $\Delta$K (21{\%}, 82/386). A troubling finding was that very few studies performed the hierarchical analysis recommended by the authors of both $\Delta$K and STRUCTURE to fully explore population subdivision. Furthermore, extensions of earlier simulations indicate that, with a representative number of markers, $\Delta$K frequently identifies K=2 as the top level of hierarchical structure, even when more subpopulations are present. This review suggests that many studies may have been over- or underestimating population genetic structure; both scenarios have serious consequences, particularly with respect to conservation and management. We recommend publication standards for population structure results so that readers can assess the implications of the results given their own understanding of the species biology.},

	abstract = {The complete mitochondrial genome of the alligator, Alligator mississippiensis, was sequenced. The size of the molecule is 16,642 nucleotides. Previously reported rearrangements of tRNAs in crocodile mitochondrial genomes were confirmed and, relative to mammals, no other deviations of gene order were observed. The analysis of protein-coding genes of the alligator showed an evolutionary rate that is roughly the same as in mammals. Thus, the evolutionary rate in the alligator is faster than that in birds as well as that in cold-blooded vertebrates. This contradicts hypotheses of constant body temperatures or high metabolic rate being correlated with elevated molecular evolutionary rates. It is commonly acknowledged that birds are the closest living relatives to crocodiles. Birds and crocodiles represent the only archosaurian survivors of the mass extinction at the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary. On the basis of mitochondrial protein-coding genes, the Haemothermia hypothesis, which defines birds and mammals as sister groups and thus challenges the traditional view, could be rejected. Maximum-likelihood branch length data of amino acid sequences suggest that the divergence between the avian and crocodilian lineages took place at approximately equal to 254 MYA.},

	abstract = {The complete mitochondrial genomes of two reptiles, the common iguana (Iguana iguana) and the caiman (Caiman crocodylus), were sequenced in order to investigate phylogenetic questions of tetrapod evolution. The addition of the two species allows analysis of reptilian relationships using data sets other than those including only fast-evolving species. The crocodilian mitochondrial genomes seem to have evolved generally at a higher rate than those of other vertebrates. Phylogenetic analyses of 2889 amino-acid sites from 35 mitochondrial genomes supported the bird-crocodile relationship, lending no support to the Haematotherma hypothesis (with birds and mammals representing sister groups). The analyses corroborated the view that turtles are at the base of the bird-crocodile branch. This position of the turtles makes Diapsida paraphyletic. The origin of the squamates was estimated at 294 million years (Myr) ago and that of the turtles at 278 Myr ago. Phylogenetic analysis of mammalian relationships using the additional outgroups corroborated the Marsupionta hypothesis, which joins the monotremes and the marsupials to the exclusion of the eutherians.},

But, so far, no consensus has emerged on which mutation model should be used, though this is of paramount importance for analysis of population genetic structure. However, this is not surprising given the variety of microsatellite molecular motifs. Null alleles may be disturbing for population studies, even though their presence can be detected through careful population analyses, while homoplasy seems of little concern, at least over short evolutionary scales. Interspecific studies show that microsatellites are poor markers for phylogenetic inference. However, these studies are fuelling discussions on directional mutation and the role of selection and recombination in their evolution. Nonetheless, it remains true that microsatellites may be considered as good, neutral mendelian markers.},

In a novel approach, groups of authors were paired to represent biogeographic and ecological perspectives on each of four topics: niche, comparative ecology and macroecology, community assembly, and diversity. Collectively, this compilation identifies points of agreement and disagreement between the two views on these central topics, and points to future research directions that may build on agreements and reconcile differences.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The population genetic pattern known as "isolation by distance" results from spatially limited gene flow and is a commonly observed phenomenon in natural populations. However, few software programs exist for estimating the degree of isolation by distance among populations, and they tend not to be user-friendly. RESULTS: We have created Isolation by Distance Web Service (IBDWS) a user-friendly web interface for determining patterns of isolation by distance. Using this site, population geneticists can perform a variety of powerful statistical tests including Mantel tests, Reduced Major Axis (RMA) regression analysis, as well as calculate FST between all pairs of populations and perform basic summary statistics (e.g., heterozygosity). All statistical results, including publication-quality scatter plots in Postscript format, are returned rapidly to the user and can be easily downloaded. CONCLUSION: IBDWS population genetics analysis software is hosted at http://phage.sdsu.edu/{\~{}}jensen/ and documentation is available at http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/pub/andy/IBD.html.

@article{Jessop2007,
	abstract = {Species inhabiting archipelagos are often characterised by high levels of interpopulation divergence (e.g. size related traits). This divergence may, in turn, influence their life-history. To facilitate better management and conservation of the Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), an island endemic, we identified demographic differences between two island populations in Komodo National Park, Indonesia. Comparison of data collected from dragon populations inhabiting Rinca Island and the much smaller Gili Motang Island indicated that between 1994 and 2004, the Komodo dragon population on Gili Motang significantly decreased its: (1) mean body mass, (2) body condition and (3) relative abundance. These results suggest that the numerically small Gili Motang population was oscillating downwards; in contrast, the Rinca Island population had been relatively stable. More importantly these results emphasize the necessity for managers of this priority conservation species to understand further the inherent functional differences among dragon populations to develop island specific management units. Current management practices (e.g. monitoring) instigated by Komodo National Park management ignore small island dragon populations and thus run the risk of being unable to detect adverse effects for populations that are potentially most prone to decline. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Results: In this article we provide a new HGT-oriented likelihood framework for many problems that involve phylogeny-based HGT detection and reconstruction. Beside the formulation of various likelihood criteria, we show that most of these problems are NP-hard, and offer heuristics for efficient and accurate reconstruction of HGT under these criteria. We implemented our heuristics and used them to analyze biological as well as synthetic data. In both cases, our criteria and heuristics exhibited very good performance with respect to identifying the correct number of HGT events as well as inferring their correct location on the species tree. {\textcopyright} 2006 Oxford University Press.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Phylogenies - the evolutionary histories of groups of organisms - play a major role in representing relationships among biological entities. Although many biological processes can be effectively modeled as tree-like relationships, others, such as hybrid speciation and horizontal gene transfer (HGT), result in networks, rather than trees, of relationships. Hybrid speciation is a significant evolutionary mechanism in plants, fish and other groups of species. HGT plays a major role in bacterial genome diversification and is a significant mechanism by which bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics. Maximum parsimony is one of the most commonly used criteria for phylogenetic tree inference. Roughly speaking, inference based on this criterion seeks the tree that minimizes the amount of evolution. In 1990, Jotun Hein proposed using this criterion for inferring the evolution of sequences subject to recombination. Preliminary results on small synthetic datasets. Nakhleh et al. (2005) demonstrated the criterion's application to phylogenetic network reconstruction in general and HGT detection in particular. However, the naive algorithms used by the authors are inapplicable to large datasets due to their demanding computational requirements. Further, no rigorous theoretical analysis of computing the criterion was given, nor was it tested on biological data. Results: In the present work we prove that the problem of scoring the parsimony of a phylogenetic network is NP-hard and provide an improved fixed parameter tractable algorithm for it. Further, we devise efficient heuristics for parsimony-based reconstruction of phylogenetic networks. We test our methods on both synthetic and biological data (rbcL gene in bacteria) and obtain very promising results. {\textcopyright} 2007 Oxford University Press.},

@article{Jin2007a,
	abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) may result in genes whose evolutionary histories disagree with each other, as well as with the species tree. In this case, reconciling the species and gene trees results in a network of relationships, known as the "phylogenetic network" of the set of species. A phylogenetic network that incorporates HGT consists of an underlying species tree that captures vertical inheritance and a set of edges which model the "horizontal" transfer of genetic material. In a series of papers, Nakhleh and colleagues have recently formulated a maximum parsimony (MP) criterion for phylogenetic networks, provided an array of computationally efficient algorithms and heuristics for computing it, and demonstrated its plausibility on simulated data. In this article, we study the performance and robustness of this criterion on biological data. Our findings indicate that MP is very promising when its application is extended to the domain of phylogenetic network reconstruction and HGT detection. In all cases we investigated, the MP criterion detected the correct number of HGT events required to map the evolutionary history of a gene data set onto the species phylogeny. Furthermore, our results indicate that the criterion is robust with respect to both incomplete taxon sampling and the use of different site substitution matrices. Finally, our results show that the MP criterion is very promising in detecting HGT in chimeric genes, whose evolutionary histories are a mix of vertical and horizontal evolution. Besides the performance analysis of MP, our findings offer new insights into the evolution of 4 biological data sets and new possible explanations of HGT scenarios in their evolutionary history. {\textcopyright} The Author 2006.

	abstract = {Lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera) are often considered a model group of parasites for studies of cospeciation because of their high host specificity, and louse species in the genus Brueelia are relatively host-specific. To test the extent of cospeciation, we reconstructed a phylogeny for Brueelia from nuclear (EF103B1) and mitochondrial (COI) DNA sequences. This phylogeny was generally well resolved and supported. Two major clades within Brueelia (as well as several other lineages) were identified, and these corresponded to major morphological differences in the preantennal region of the head and sclerotization of the abdomen. However, the phylogeny of Brueelia showed little concordance to a published phylogeny of the hosts. In addition, we uncovered four cases (out of 15 species) of one species of Brueelia on two or more bird species. We argue that the high dispersal capabilities of Brueelia species, e.g. phoresis on hippoboscid flies, are a likely explanation for the incongruence between host and parasite phylogenies in this case. {\textcopyright} 2002 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 2002, 77, 2332013247.},

	abstract = {Increasing attention is being devoted to taking landscape information into account in genetic studies. Among landscape variables, space is often considered as one of the most important. To reveal spatial patterns, a statistical method should be spatially explicit, that is, it should directly take spatial information into account as a component of the adjusted model or of the optimized criterion. In this paper we propose a new spatially explicit multivariate method, spatial principal component analysis (sPCA), to investigate the spatial pattern of genetic variability using allelic frequency data of individuals or populations. This analysis does not require data to meet Hardy-Weinberg expectations or linkage equilibrium to exist between loci. The sPCA yields scores summarizing both the genetic variability and the spatial structure among individuals (or populations). Global structures (patches, clines and intermediates) are disentangled from local ones (strong genetic differences between neighbors) and from random noise. Two statistical tests are proposed to detect the existence of both types of patterns. As an illustration, the results of principal component analysis (PCA) and sPCA are compared using simulated datasets and real georeferenced microsatellite data of Scandinavian brown bear individuals (Ursus arctos). sPCA performed better than PCA to reveal spatial genetic patterns. The proposed methodology is implemented in the adegenet package of the free software R.},

	abstract = {The use of molecular techniques for parentage analysis has been a booming science for over a decade. The most important technological breakthrough was the introduction of microsatellite markers to molecular ecology, an advance that was accompanied by a proliferation and refinement of statistical techniques for the analysis of parentage data. Over the last several years, we have seen steady progress in a number of areas related to parentage analysis, and the prospects for successful studies continue to improve. Here, we provide an updated guide for scientists interested in embarking on parentage analysis in natural or artificial populations of organisms, with a particular focus on computer software packages that implement various methods of analysis. Our survey of the literature shows that there are a few established methods that perform extremely well in the analysis of most types of parentage studies. However, particular experimental designs or study systems can benefit from some of the less well-known computer packages available. Overall, we find that parentage analysis is feasible and satisfying in most systems, and we try to provide a simple roadmap to help other scientists navigate the confusing topography of statistical techniques.},

	abstract = {Assessing the impacts of multiple, often synergistic, stressors on the population dynamics of long-lived species is becoming increasingly important due to recent and future global change. Tiliqua rugosa (sleepy lizard) is a long-lived skink ({\textgreater}30 years) that is adapted to survive in semi-arid environments with varying levels of parasite exposure and highly seasonal food availability. We used an exhaustive database of 30 years of capture-mark-recapture records to quantify the impacts of both parasite exposure and environmental conditions on the lizard's survival rates and long-term population dynamics. Lizard abundance was relatively stable throughout the study period; however, there were changing patterns in adult and juvenile apparent survival rates, driven by spatial and temporal variation in levels of tick exposure and temporal variation in environmental conditions. Extreme weather events during the winter and spring seasons were identified as important environmental drivers of survival. Climate models predict a dramatic increase in the frequency of extreme hot and dry winter and spring seasons in our South Australian study region; from a contemporary probability of 0{\textperiodcentered}17 up to 0{\textperiodcentered}47-0{\textperiodcentered}83 in 2080 depending on the emissions scenario. Our stochastic population model projections showed that these future climatic conditions will induce a decline in the abundance of this long-lived reptile of up to 67{\%} within 30 years from 2080, under worst case scenario modelling. The results have broad implications for future work investigating the drivers of population dynamics and persistence. We highlight the importance of long-term data sets and accounting for synergistic impacts between multiple stressors. We show that predicted increases in the frequency of extreme climate events have the potential to considerably and negatively influence a long-lived species, which might previously have been assumed to be resilient to environmental perturbations.},

	abstract = {Pedigrees, depicting genealogical relationships between individuals, are important in several research areas. Molecular markers allow inference of pedigrees in wild species where relationship information is impossible to collect by observation. Marker data are analysed statistically using methods based on Mendelian inheritance rules. There are numerous computer programs available to conduct pedigree analysis, but most software is inflexible, both in terms of assumptions and data requirements. Most methods only accommodate monogamous diploid species using codominant markers without genotyping error. In addition, most commonly used methods use pairwise comparisons rather than a full-pedigree likelihood approach, which considers the likelihood of the entire pedigree structure and allows the simultaneous inference of parentage and sibship. Here, we describe colony, a computer program implementing full-pedigree likelihood methods to simultaneously infer sibship and parentage among individuals using multilocus genotype data. colony can be used for both diploid and haplodiploid species; it can use dominant and codominant markers, and can accommodate, and estimate, genotyping error at each locus. In addition, colony can carry out these inferences for both monoecious and dioecious species. The program is available as a Microsoft Windows version, which includes a graphical user interface, and a Macintosh version, which uses an R-based interface.},

	abstract = {The advent of miniaturized biologging devices has provided ecologists with unprecedented opportunities to record animal movement across scales, and led to the collection of ever-increasing quantities of tracking data. In parallel, sophisticated tools have been developed to process, visualize and analyse tracking data; however, many of these tools have proliferated in isolation, making it challenging for users to select the most appropriate method for the question in hand. Indeed, within the r software alone, we listed 58 packages created to deal with tracking data or `tracking packages'. Here, we reviewed and described each tracking package based on a workflow centred around tracking data (i.e. spatio-temporal locations (x, y, t)), broken down into three stages: pre-processing, post-processing and analysis, the latter consisting of data visualization, track description, path reconstruction, behavioural pattern identification, space use characterization, trajectory simulation and others. Supporting documentation is key to render a package accessible for users. Based on a user survey, we reviewed the quality of packages' documentation and identified 11 packages with good or excellent documentation. Links between packages were assessed through a network graph analysis. Although a large group of packages showed some degree of connectivity (either depending on functions or suggesting the use of another tracking package), one third of the packages worked in isolation, reflecting a fragmentation in the r movement-ecology programming community. Finally, we provide recommendations for users when choosing packages, and for developers to maximize the usefulness of their contribution and strengthen the links within the programming community.},

Bias in this so-called temporal method has been noted in cases of small sample sizes and when allele frequencies are highly skewed. We characterize bias in commonly applied estimators under different sampling plans and propose an alternative estimator for genetic drift and effective size that weights alleles differently. Numerical evaluations of exact probability distributions and computer simulations verify that this new estimator yields unbiased estimates also when based on a modest number of alleles and loci. At the cost of a larger standard deviation, it thus eliminates the bias associated with earlier estimators. The new estimator should be particularly useful for microsatellite loci and panels of SNPs, representing a large number of alleles, many of which will occur at low frequencies.},

In this study, heterozygosity--fitness correlations (HFCs) were measured by genotyping 7 loci in 83 adult and 184 hatchling Lesser Antillean Iguanas, Iguana delicatissima, at a communal nesting site in Dominica to assess the role of in- breeding depression on hatchling fitness and recruitment to the adult population in this endangered species. We found insignificant correlations between multilocus het- erozygosity and multiple fitness proxies in hatchlings and adults. Further, multilocus heterozygosity did not differ significantly between hatchlings and adults, which sug- gests that the survivorship of homozygous hatchlings does not differ markedly from that of their heterozygous counterparts. However, genotypes at two individual loci were correlated with hatching date, a finding consistent with the linkage between specific marker loci and segregating deleterious recessive alleles. These results pro- vide only modest evidence that inbreeding depression influences the population dy- namics of I. delicatissima on Dominica.},

	abstract = {Basic information, such as population size and density, is needed for conservation and management of many species, especially threatened species. Thus, well-designed population monitoring programs that use appropriate methods for estimating parameters of interest, including density and survival, are needed as well. Mark-recapture and distance-sampling are established methods for estimating density in wildlife surveys. The sand dune lizard (Liolaemus multimaculatus) is an endemic and vulnerable species that inhabits dune habitats in Argentina. At present, however, there are no accurate estimates of density of this species and no established monitoring programs. The objectives of this study were (1) to test the use of mark- recapture and distance-sampling methods and (2) to estimate density of this species in Mar Chiquita Reserve (37u 379 S--57u 169 W), an important area for the protection of this species. For distance-sampling surveys, we used a systematic line-transect design; for mark-recapture sampling, we performed exhaustive surveys and captured, marked, and recaptured lizards manually. Based on distance-sampling, populations were estimated at 3.6 and 5.4 individuals per ha in 2007 and 2008, respectively; corresponding estimates based on mark- recapture data were 5.2 and 4.1 individuals per ha in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Detection probabilities were 0.23 in both 2007 and 2008 distance-sampling analyses and capture probabilities were 0.02 and 0.05 in 2007 and 2008 mark-recapture analyses. Based on these estimates, the Mar Chiquita Reserve contains a population of at least 10,000 individuals. Both methods were adequate for estimating populations of sand dune lizards, given the facility with which individuals can be detected and captured. The distance-sampling method requires less effort, but the mark-recapture method allows estimates of survival as well as density. Results of this work provide the baseline for developing a monitoring program for this lizard, and we suggest that the distance-sampling method be used to monitor all populations of sand dune lizard},

Furthermore, few tools exist that are specifically designed for analyzing data from clonal populations, making analysis difficult and haphazard. We developed the R package poppr providing unique tools for analysis of data from admixed, clonal, mixed, and/or sexual populations. Currently, poppr can be used for dominant/codominant and haploid/diploid genetic data. Data can be imported from several formats including GenAlEx formatted text files and can be analyzed on a user-defined hierarchy that includes unlimited levels of subpopulation structure and clone censoring. New functions include calculation of Bruvo's distance for microsatellites, batch-analysis of the index of association with several indices of genotypic diversity, and graphing including dendrograms with bootstrap support and minimum spanning networks. While functions for genotypic diversity and clone censoring are specific for clonal populations, several functions found in poppr are also valuable to analysis of any populations. A manual with documentation and examples is provided. Poppr is open source and major releases are available on CRAN: http://cran.r-project.org/package=poppr.

	abstract = {To gain a detailed understanding of how plant microbes evolve and adapt to hosts, pesticides, and other factors, knowledge of the population dynamics and evolutionary history of populations is crucial. Plant pathogen populations are often clonal or partially clonal which requires different analytical tools. With the advent of high throughput sequencing technologies, obtaining genome-wide population genetic data has become easier than ever before. We previously contributed the R package poppr specifically addressing issues with analysis of clonal populations. In this paper we provide several significant extensions to poppr with a focus on large, genome-wide SNP data. Specifically, we provide several new functionalities including the new function mlg.filter to define clone boundaries allowing for inspection and definition of what is a clonal lineage, minimum spanning networks with reticulation, a sliding-window analysis of the index of association, modular bootstrapping of any genetic distance, and analyses across any level of hierarchies.},

@article{Kardos2014,
	abstract = {Heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFCs) have been observed for several decades, but their causes are often elusive. Tests for identity disequilibrium (ID, correlated heterozygosity between loci) are commonly used to determine if inbreeding depression is a possible cause of HFCs. We used computer simulations to determine how often ID is detected when HFCs are caused by inbreeding depression. We also used ID in conjunction with HFCs to estimate the proportion of variation (r(2)) in fitness explained by the individual inbreeding coefficient (F). ID was not detected in a large proportion of populations with statistically significant HFCs (sample size = 120 individuals) unless the variance of F was high ($\sigma$(2)(F) ≥ 0.005) or many loci were used (100 microsatellites or 1000 SNPs). For example, with 25 microsatellites, ID was not detected in 49{\%} of populations when HFCs were caused by six lethal equivalents and $\sigma$(2)(F) was typical of vertebrate populations ($\sigma$(2)(F) ≈ 0.002). Estimates of r(2) between survival and F based on ID and HFCs were imprecise unless ID was strong and highly statistically significant (P ≈ 0.01). These results suggest that failing to detect ID in HFC studies should not be taken as evidence that inbreeding depression is absent. The number of markers necessary to simultaneously detect HFC and ID depends strongly on $\sigma$(2)(F). Thus the mating system and demography of populations, which influence $\sigma$(2) (F), should be considered when designing HFC studies. ID should be used in conjunction with HFCs to estimate the correlation between fitness and F, because HFCs alone reveal little about the strength of inbreeding depression.},

	abstract = {The magnitude of inbreeding depression caused by recessive mutations in a population is dependent on the mutation rate and on the intensity of selection against the mutations. We studied geographical differences in the level of early inbreeding depression of Scots pine in a common garden experiment. The mean abortion rate of experimentally self-pollinated seeds was significantly lower (75.4{\%}) among trees that originated from northern populations (66-69 degrees N) than among trees from more southern (60-62 degrees N) populations (86.5{\%}). Thus, the number of embryonic lethal equivalents was lower in the northern populations (4.5) than in the southern ones (6.9). The outcrossing rate at the mature seed stage was slightly lower in the northern populations (average 0.93) than in the southern one (0.99). The estimated selfing rate at the zygote stage varied from 0-0.28 in the populations. The reduction in the magnitude of inbreeding depression in the north may have been caused by increased levels of self-fertilization in the northern populations. The proportion of self-fertilized seedlings and adults was very small in all populations (F approximate to 0), indicating high inbreeding depression also in later life stages. The high level of inbreeding depression in the partially selfing Scots pine can be explained by mutation-selection balance only if the mutation rate is high.},

For climate variations over years, decades, centuries, and well beyond, the Gal?pagos is geographically positioned in the heart of some of the largest and most important changes. Models and observations provide compelling evidence that the Gal?pagos cannot be neglected in regional and basin-scale ocean dynamics and biogeochemistry, warranting further measurements and hypothesis-testing. Differences between various model experiments and their potential implications for the physical and biogeochemical state of the tropical Pacific Ocean make a clear case that much depends on the nature of the island-current interactions and processes involved. Implications for climate model improvement and global change are discussed.},

Darwin's finches in the Galapagos, cichlid fishes in African Rift and Nicaraguan crater lakes, and the emergence of mammals at the end of the Cretaceous are hallmark examples. Although we have learned much from these and other case studies about the mechanisms thought to drive adaptive radiations, convincing experimental tests of theory are often lacking for the simple reason that it is usually impossible to "rewind the tape of life," as Stephen Jay Gould was fond of saying, and run it again. This situation has changed dramatically in recent years with the increasing emphasis on the use of microbial populations which, because of their small size and rapid generation times, make possible the construction of replicated, manipulative experiments to study evolution in the laboratory. Here I review the contributions that microbial experimental evolution has made to our understanding of the ecological and genetic mechanisms underlying adaptive radiation. I focus on three major gaps in the theory of adaptive radiation--the paucity of direct tests of mechanism, the genetics of diversification, and the limits and constraints on the progress of radiations--with the aim of pointing the way toward the development of a more general theory of adaptive radiation.},

They are a paradigm for testing evolutionary hypotheses about traits favoured by particular environmental factors. This paper is an attempt to summarize the conceptual framework for local adaptation studies. We first review theoretical work relevant for local adaptation. Then we discuss reciprocal transplant and common garden experiments designed to detect local adaptation in the pattern of deme x habitat interaction for fitness. Finally, we review research questions and approaches to studying the processes of local adaptation - divergent natural selection, dispersal and gene flow, and other processes affecting adaptive differentiation of local demes. We advocate multifaceted approaches to the study of local adaptation, and stress the need for experiments explicitly addressing hypotheses about the role of particular ecological and genetic factors that promote or hinder local adaptation. Experimental evolution of replicated populations in controlled spatially heterogeneous environments allow direct tests of such hypotheses, and thus would be a valuable way to complement research on natural populations.},

Genetic data from the dwarf mongoose, a pack-living carnivore common in African savannas, indicate that there are exceptions to this generalization. In dwarf mongoose populations in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, breeding pairs are commonly related, and close inbreeding has no measurable effect on offspring production or adult survival. Inbreeding occurs because average relatedness among potential mates within a pack is high, because mating patterns within the pack are random with respect to the relatedness of mates, and because dispersal does little to decrease the relatedness among mates. Young females are more likely to leave a pack when the dominant male is a close relative but are relatively infrequent dispersers. Young males emigrate at random with respect to the relatedness of die dominant female and tend to disperse to packs that contain genetically similar individuals.},

	abstract = {The human mutation rate per nucleotide site per generation ($\mu$) can be estimated from data on mutation rates at loci causing Mendelian genetic disease, by comparing putatively neutrally evolving nucleotide sequences between humans and chimpanzees and by comparing the genome sequences of relatives. Direct estimates from genome sequencing of relatives suggest that $\mu$ is about 1.1 × 10(-8), which is about twofold lower than estimates based on the human-chimp divergence. This implies that an average of {\~{}}70 new mutations arise in the human diploid genome per generation. Most of these mutations are paternal in origin, but the male:female mutation rate ratio is currently uncertain and might vary even among individuals within a population. On the basis of a method proposed by Kondrashov and Crow, the genome-wide deleterious mutation rate (U) can be estimated from the product of the number of nucleotide sites in the genome, $\mu$, and the mean selective constraint per site. Although the presence of many weakly selected mutations in human noncoding DNA makes this approach somewhat problematic, estimates are U ≈ 2.2 for the whole diploid genome per generation and 0.35 for mutations that change an amino acid of a protein-coding gene. A genome-wide deleterious mutation rate of 2.2 seems higher than humans could tolerate if natural selection is "hard," but could be tolerated if selection acts on relative fitness differences between individuals or if there is synergistic epistasis. I argue that in the foreseeable future, an accumulation of new deleterious mutations is unlikely to lead to a detectable decline in fitness of human populations.},

	abstract = {We studied mate choice and inbreeding avoidance a natural population of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) on Mandarte Island, Canada. Inbreeding occurred regularly: 59{\%} all matings were between known relatives. We tested for inbreeding avoidance by comparing the observed levels of inbreeding to those expected if mate choice had been random with respect to relatedness. Independent of our assumptions about the availability of mates in the random mating model, we found that the expected and observed distributions of inbreeding coefficients were similar, as was the expected and observed frequency of close (f {\textgreater}/= 0.125) inbreeding. Furthermore, there was no difference in relatedness observed pairs and those that would have resulted had birds mated instead with their nearest neighbors. The only evidence to suggest any inbreeding avoidance was a reduced rate of parent-offspring matings as compared to one random mating model but not the other. Hence, despite substantial inbreeding depression in this population, we found little evidence for inbreeding avoidance through mate choice. We present a simple model to suggest that variation in inbreeding avoidance behaviors in birds may arise from differences in survival rates: in species with low survival rates, the costs of forfeiting matings to avoid inbreeding may exceed the costs of inbreeding.},

	abstract = {The genetic and demographic consequences of population subdivision have received considerable attention from conservation biologists. In particular, losses of genetic variability and reduced viability and fecundity due to inbreeding (inbreeding depression) are of concern. Studies of domestic, laboratory and zoo populations have shown inbreeding depression in a variety of traits related to fitness. Consequently, inbreeding depression is widely accepted as a fact. Recently, however, the relative impact of inbreeding on the viability of natural populations has been questioned. Work on the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), for example, has emphasized the overwhelming importance of environmental factors on mortality in the wild. Here we report that song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) that survived a severe population bottleneck were a non-random subset of the pre-crash population with respect to inbreeding, and that natural selection favoured outbred individuals. Thus, inbreeding depression was expressed in the face of an environmental challenge. Such challenges are also likely to be faced by inbred populations of endangered species. We suggest that environmental and genetic effects on survival may interact and, as a consequence, that their effects on individuals and populations should not be considered independently.},

	abstract = {Whether inbreeding affects the demography and persistence of natural populations has been questioned. However, new pedigree data from field populations and molecular and analytical tools for tracing patterns of relationship and inbreeding have now enhanced our ability to detect inbreeding depression within and among wild populations. This work reveals that levels of inbreeding depression vary across taxa, populations and environments, but are usually substantial enough to affect both individual and population performance. Data from bird and mammal populations suggest that inbreeding depression often significantly affects birth weight, survival, reproduction and resistance to disease, predation and environmental stress. Plant studies, based mostly on comparing populations that differ in size or levels of genetic variation, also reveal significant inbreeding effects on seed set, germination, survival and resistance to stress. Data from butterflies, birds and plants demonstrate that populations with reduced genetic diversity often experience reduced growth and increased extinction rates. Crosses between such populations often result in heterosis. Such a genetic rescue effect might reflect the masking of fixed deleterious mutations. Thus, it might be necessary to retain gene flow among increasingly fragmented habitat patches to sustain populations that are sensitive to inbreeding.},

	abstract = {Admixture, the mixing of historically isolated gene pools, can have immediate consequences for the genetic architecture of fitness traits. Admixture may be especially important for newly colonized populations, such as during range expansion and species invasions, by generating heterozygosity that can boost fitness through heterosis. Despite widespread evidence for admixture during species invasions, few studies have examined the demographic history leading to admixture, how admixture affects the heterozygosity and fitness of invasive genotypes, and whether such fitness effects are maintained through time. We address these questions using the invasive plant Silene vulgaris, which shows evidence of admixture in both its native Europe and in North America where it has invaded. Using multilocus genotype data in conjunction with approximate Bayesian computation analysis of demographic history, we showed that admixture during the invasion of North America was independent from and much younger than admixture in the native range of Europe. We tested for fitness consequences of admixture in each range and detected a significant positive heterozygosity--fitness correlation (HFC) in North America; in contrast, no HFC was present in Europe. The lack of HFC in Europe may reflect the longer time since admixture in the native range, dissipating associations between heterozygosity at markers and fitness loci. Our results support a key short-term role for admixture during the early stages of invasion by generating HFCs that carry populations past the threat of extinction from inbreeding and demographic stochasticity.},

	abstract = {Whether population regulation is global or local determines if hard or soft selection. respectively. is operating. Differences between hard and soft selection, in turn, affect the maintenance of genetic variation and the mean strength of natural selection in heterogeneous environments. Here we investigated whether there were differences in the strength of soft and hard selection on plant defence traits in a spatially replicated field experiment with Arabidopsis thaliana. We estimated selection gradients for basal branch number and susceptibility to apical meristem herbivory in 10 spatial environments of an Arabidopsis field experiment. Net patterns of soft selection across these 10 spatial environments were calculated as weighted averages of the selection gradients, weighted by the frequency of each environment. Hard selection was estimated in a similar fashion, except that selection gradients for each spatial environment were first multiplied by a fitness ratio that assigned more or less weight to selection gradients depending on whether local mean fitness in that environment was greater or less than global mean fitness across all environments. In general, soft selection was stronger than hard selection, possibly because selection on plant defence traits is relaxed in environments that otherwise lead to high fitness. To evaluate the sensitivity of our results to the frequency of spatial environments., we repeated our analyses under several different hypothetical scenarios in which we varied the cumulative frequency of the environments that led to highest fitness. In these analyses, we found that the mean strength of hard and soft selection, and the relative magnitude of the two estimates, varied greatly depending on the frequency of high fitness environments. These analyses also revealed that estimates of the overall pattern of selection in spatially heterogeneous environments can be very sensitive to the frequency of individual. unusual environments - for example, environments with above average fitness but local patterns of selection dramatically different from other above average fitness environments. We suggest that more empirical effort be devoted to characterizing the frequency of selective environments in natural systems. although that is likely to be extremely challenging.},

	abstract = {The Pacific iguanas of the Fijian and Tongan archipelagos are a biogeographic enigma in that their closest relatives are found only in the New World. They currently comprise two genera and four species of extinct and extant taxa. The two extant species, Brachylophus fasciatus from Fiji, Tonga, and Vanuatu and Brachylophus vitiensis from western Fiji, are of considerable conservation concern with B. vitiensis listed as critically endangered. A recent molecular study has shown that Brachylophus comprised three evolutionarily significant units. To test these conclusions and to reevaluate the phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships within Brachylophus, we generated an mtDNA dataset consisting of 1462 base pairs for 61 individuals from 13 islands, representing both Brachylophus species. Unweighted parsimony analyses and Bayesian analyses produced a well-resolved phylogenetic hypothesis supported by high bootstrap values and posterior probabilities within Brachylophus. Our data reject the monophyly of specimens previously believed to comprise B. fasciatus. Instead, our data demonstrate that living Brachylophus comprise three robust and well-supported clades that do not correspond to current taxonomy. One of these clades comprises B. fasciatus from the Lau group of Fiji and Tonga (type locality for B. fasciatus), while a second comprises putative B. fasciatus from the central regions of Fiji, which we refer to here as B. n. sp. Animals in this clade form the sister group to B. vitiensis rather than other B. fasciatus. We herein describe this clade as a new species of Brachylophus based on molecular and morphological data. With only one exception, every island is home to one or more unique haplotypes. We discuss alternative biogeographic hypotheses to explain their distribution in the Pacific and the difficulties of distinguishing these. Together, our molecular and taxonomic results have important implications for future conservation initiatives for the Pacific iguanas.},

Recent studies in basal metazoans such as Nematostella, Acropora and Hydra have shed light on the function of these genes, and now indicate that they are involved in important species-specific adaptive processes. Here we focus on evidence from Hydra suggesting that taxonomically-restricted genes play a role in the creation of phylum-specific novelties such as cnidocytes, in the generation of morphological diversity, and in the innate defence system.

In spite of this, few studies have investigated the chemical composition and the behavioural roles of these secretions. The lacertid lizard Acanthodactylus boskianus is a good example, having these well-developed glands in both sexes. We used GC-MS chemical analysis of gland secretions and y-maze choice test bioassays to investigate the ability of the lizards to detect and respond to different synthetic blends made from compounds identified in the gland secretions. Based upon the GC-MS quantification data, we selected representatives of the main chemical groups (steroids, alcohols, acids, alkanes) detected in the lizard secretions and used these in a behavioural bioassay against controls. Males showed significant avoidance behaviour for cholesterol and alcohol blends, combined with agonistic behaviour towards these stimuli. Females did not show any significant selection to particular odour combinations. The data support the hypotheses that lizards can potentially use femoral gland secretions in chemical odour trails and utilize scent to mark territories and potentially also to establish dominance hierarchies. Cholesterol and long chain alcohols are suggested as potential candidates functioning as scent marking pheromones in A. boskianus. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Basel AG.},

This study describes the identification of Amblyomma ticks from wild snakes in Malaysia and the detection of potential human pathogens such as Rickettsia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia and bartonellae in the ticks. FINDINGS: Twenty one adult ticks (twelve A. varanense and nine Amblyomma helvolum ticks) identified from seven Python molurus snakes in Sepang and a pool of six A. helvolum ticks from a Naja sumatrana snake in Johore, Malaysia were investigated in this study. Amplification of the citrate synthase (gltA), 190-kDa surface antigen gene (ompA), 135-kDa surface antigen (ompB) and surface cell antigen (sca4) genes followed by sequence analysis confirmed the presence of two potential novel spotted fever group rickettsiae in the ticks. Candidatus Rickettsia sepangensis from an engorged A. varanense tick demonstrated high sequence similarity to Rickettsia tamurae; while Candidatus Rickettsia johorensis from two samples (individual and pooled) of A. helvolum and two A. varanense ticks were closely related to Rickettsia raoultii. Anaplasma and Ehrlichia DNA were detected from seven and two ticks, respectively. No bartonellae was detected from any of the ticks.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The species-rich genus Aphis consists of more than 500 species, many of them host-specific on a wide range of plants, yet very similar in general appearance due to convergence toward particular morphological types. Most species have been historically clustered into four main phenotypic groups (gossypii, craccivora, fabae, and spiraecola groups). To confirm the morphological hypotheses between these groups and to examine the characteristics that determine them, multivariate morphometric analyses were performed using 28 characters measured/counted from 40 species. To infer whether the morphological relationships are correlated with the genetic relationships, we compared the morphometric dataset with a phylogeny reconstructed from the combined dataset of three mtDNA and one nuclear DNA regions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Based on a comparison of morphological and molecular datasets, we confirmed morphological reduction or regression in the gossypii group unlike in related groups. Most morphological characteristics of the gossypii group were less variable than for the other groups. Due to these, the gossypii group could be morphologically well separated from the craccivora, fabae, and spiraecola groups. In addition, the correlation of the rates of evolution between morphological and DNA datasets was highly significant in their diversification.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The morphological separation between the gossypii group and the other species-groups are congruent with their phylogenetic relationships. Analysis of trait evolution revealed that the morphological traits found to be significant based on the morphometric analyses were confidently correlated with the phylogeny. The dominant patterns of trait evolution resulting in increased rates of short branches and temporally later evolution are likely suitable for the modality of Aphis speciation because they have adapted species-specifically, rapidly, and more recently on many different host plants.},

It would require the use of multiple disciplines and multiple objectives, dealing with technically unresolvable management problems of complex adaptive systems and expanding scope from management to governance. Developing the governance toolbox would require expanding into new kinds of interaction unforeseen by the mid-twentieth-century fathers of fishery science -- governance that may involve cooperative, multilevel management, partnerships, social learning and knowledge co-production. In addition to incorporating relatively well-known resilience, adaptive management and co-management approaches, taking EBM to the next stage may include some of the following: conceptualizing EBM as a `wicked problem'; conceptualizing fisheries as socialecological systems; picking and choosing from an assortment of new governance approaches; and finding creative ways to handle complexity.},

@article{Kimura1955,
	abstract = {After the short review of the theoretical as well as experimental results so far obtained on the problem of the random genetic drift due to small population number, the complete solution of the process of the random genetic drift for the case of a pair of alleles is illustrated. From this it is pointed out that the well known steady decay solution; $\phi$ = Ce-t/2N, though useful when the initial gene frequency is near 50{\%}, decreases in usefulness as the initial gene frequency deviates from this value (fig. 1a and 1b). The main purpose of this paper, however, is to present the general treatment of the problem of random drift for a multiallelic locus. First the asymptotic solutions are elaborated for the triallelic system. They show that as the number of generations becomes large, the rate of decay of the frequencies of the classes where only two alleles coexist approaches 1/2N per generation, while that of the classes where the 3 alleles coexist approaches 3/2N per generation. The most general result obtained is as follows: If we start from a population which contains m alleles say A1, A2,... and Am with frequencies p1, p2,... and pm respectively ($\Sigma$ pi = 1), the probability density that it contains k of them, say A1, A2,... and Ak with respective frequencies x1, x2,... and xk ($\Sigma$k 1x i = 1) in the tth generation is given asymptotically by {\$}\backslashphi{\_}1, 2,..., k (x{\_}1,x{\_}2,...,x{\_}{\{}k-1{\}};t) \backslashsim (2k - 1)!(\backslashPi{\^{}}k{\_}{\{}j=1{\}} p{\_}j) exp {\{}- k(k-1)t/4N{\}},{\$} where k {\textless} m. This indicates that as the number of coexisting alleles increases, the rate by which that state is eliminated increases with rapid progression. In this sense, random drift might be effective in keeping down the number of coexisting alleles in the population.},

	abstract = {Some simple formulae were obtained which enable us to estimate evolutionary distances in terms of the number of nucleotide substitutions (and, also, the evolutionary rates when the divergence times are known). In comparing a pair of nucleotide sequences, we distinguish two types of differences; if homologous sites are occupied by different nucleotide bases but both are purines or both pyrimidines, the difference is called type I (or "transition" type), while, if one of the two is a purine and the other is a pyrimidine, the difference is called type II (or "transversion" type). Letting P and Q be respectively the fractions of nucleotide sites showing type I and type II differences between two sequences compared, then the evolutionary distance per site is K = - (1/2) ln {\{}(1 - 2P - Q) {\}}. The evolutionary rate per year is then given by k = K/(2T), where T is the time since the divergence of the two sequences. If only the third codon positions are compared, the synonymous component of the evolutionary base substitutions per site is estimated by K'S = - (1/2) ln (1 - 2P - Q). Also, formulae for standard errors were obtained. Some examples were worked out using reported globin sequences to show that synonymous substitutions occur at much higher rates than amino acid-altering substitutions in evolution. {\textcopyright} 1980 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {The relationship between dispersal and predator--prey interactions in heterogeneous landscapes is an underappreciated factor influencing species persistence. This relationship, however, is critical for understanding population dynamics and for implementing management strategies for species. We investigated the influence of habitat heterogeneity and dispersal patterns on neonate survival for the iguana Cyclura cychlura cychlura inhabiting Andros Island in the Bahamas. Contrary to our hypothesis, there was a clear survival advantage for neonates that spent more time in open mangrove habitat than relatively more closed-canopy habitats, most likely because of fewer primary predators in mangroves relative to other habitats. Snake predation was the most significant cause of mortality for neonates dispersing away from nest sites and was highest during the first week after release. The probability of survival to 28 days ranged from 16.7 to 28.4{\%}. Most neonates displayed rapid, nearly linear movements away from nests for a minimum of 14 to 21 days. Mean straight-line distance away from nest sites for surviving neonates was 601 m. There was a significant positive relationship between mean daily movement rates away from nests and days survived. We suspect that the initial and rapid movements away from nests reduce relative predation by dispersing neonates from a zone where predators learn to exploit them. Our results have implications for translocation programs targeting endangered insular iguanas throughout the Neotropics because historically only the presence of non-native mammalian predators was used as a metric to evaluate potential translocation sites.},

	abstract = {Intraspecific comparisons among geographically separated populations of wide-ranging species are particularly useful in elucidating variation in behavioral and reproductive life histories resulting from proximate and ultimate causes. From 2001 to 2004, we investigated geographic variation in nesting behavior and reproductive biology of a large-bodied Bahamian iguana (Cyclura cychlura Cuvier, 1829) inhabiting two distinct island systems varying in area, topography, and rainfall. Studies of C. cychlura cychlura were conducted on Andros Island (approx. 6000 km(2); annual rainfall 1100 to 1300 mm) and the results were compared with those for C. cychulra inornata Barbour and Noble, 1916 inhabiting two cays (each {\textless} 4 ha; annual rainfall {\textless} 600 mm) in the northern Exuma Island chain (approx. 140 km distant). Female iguanas from Andros Island initiated oviposition 5 to 6 weeks earlier than females from the Exumas. The Andros Island population deposited eggs primarily in termitaria, whereas the lizards in the Exumas deposited eggs in subterranean sand chambers. Female iguanas from Andros deposited significantly more eggs per clutch, heavier total clutches, and wider eggs than conspecifics from the Exumas. Despite egg size differences, hatchling snout-vent length and body mass per clutch did not differ significantly between the Andros and Exuma populations. Our results support the hypothesis that proximate environmental factors play an important role in determining geographic variation associated with not only reproductive output but also reproductive behavior.},

	abstract = {Using microsatellite analysis, we investigated the reproductive success and genetic structure of a translocated colony of the Bahamian iguana (Cyclura cychlura inornata) 10-yr post introduction. We investigated the reproductive success of the founder males to determine if all were contributing equally to the descendant gene pool. We compared the genetic diversity in the founder population with that in the incipient, translocated population to determine if the number of translocated individuals was sufficient to retain the genetic diversity derived from the source population. In 1999, the estimated population size for the translocated colony was between 75 and 90 individuals. Blood was taken from 35 iguanas (16 males, 18 females, and 1 juvenile) of mixed age, including the four original translocated males and three of the four original translocated females. Of the eight polymorphic microsatellite loci in C. cychlura, only five were polymorphic in C. c. inornata. With two exceptions, the low average allelic diversity and heterozygosity among these loci (2.4 and 0.45, respectively) hindered accurate determination of parentage among the founders. Nevertheless, the data indicated that the potential parental contributions appear equal for the founder males and that, at 10-yr Post introduction, the small amount of genetic diversity at the amplified loci in the founding population was retained. The low level of genetic variation appears to have no negative short-term effects on the translocated or other populations of C. cychlura inhabiting the Exuma Island chain, making them excellent candidates for translocation and repatriation programs if physiological and environmental requirements are met.},

There is interest by local and national conservation organisations to demarcate protected areas for the iguana in the southern portion of its range. However, no life history information is available for the lizard. In order to provide data that can be applied in a science-based management strategy for the Andros iguana, we investigated seasonal variation in home-range size and habitat selection of the iguana using radio telemetry. Home ranges were the largest reported to date for free-ranging Cyclura iguanas (Fixed 95{\%} Kernel maximums: 30.58 ha for males, 5.63 ha for females). Habitat selection using the Euclidean Distance method revealed that open pine was the only habitat type out of four where iguanas occurred more than expected by chance. However, the pair-wise comparisons of habitat types reveal that iguanas were found significantly closer to open pine and shrubland than to closed pine. We failed to uncover selection of cumulative home-range placement throughout our multi-habitat study areas. Conservation implications of the dynamic seasonal home-range fluctuations and habitat usage are discussed and recommendations are offered for establishing protected areas.},

	abstract = {Nest-site selection and the behavioral mechanisms driving selection h ave received relatively little attention in nesting ecology studies despite their importance whe n establishing conservation and management programs for endangered taxa that have obligate habitat-spec ific nesting requirements. The nesting ecology of Cyclura cychlura cychlura was studied on Andros Island, Bahamas, from 2001 to 2004 to elucidate factors influencing nest site selection and address conservat ion and management implications. Female iguanas predominantly used active Nasutitermes rippertii (Termitidae: Isoptera) termite mounds as egg incubation chambers. Nesting females selected mounds with . 5 cm surrounding soil depth and initiated excavation and oviposition in early May. There was no correlation between female body size and termite mound size. Tunnels were excavated into lateral sides of mounds and termin ated in nest chambers. Eggs were deposited outside the mound and pushed into the chamber using thrusts of the forelimbs. Mean egg incubation length for the combined 2003 and 2004 seasons was 75.7 days. Tem peratures inside the mound were warmer and less variable than corresponding ambient temperatures. M ean hatching success for clutches in monitored nests ranged from 69.9--100 {\%} from 2002 to 2004. The nesting behavior of C. cychlura on Andros most likely reflects the effects of local climatic history and topo graphy on reproductive attributes such as nest success. Elucidating annual female nesting effort, as indica ted by active nests, could be an extremely useful indicator to assess both the number of breeding females a nd, indirectly, the potential for hatchling recruitment},

Fewer studies, however, have examined intraspecific responses to ectoparasitic burdens. In this study, we analyzed host health and fitness responses to increasing ectoparasite burdens along with the presence/absence of hemoparasites of free-ranging insular rock iguanas (Cyclura cychlura) in The Bahamas. Using hematology, plasma biochemistry, as well as body condition and growth rate comparisons, we failed to find significant associations of tick burdens with annual growth rate, corticosterone, packed cell volume, total white blood cell, and heterophil, monocyte, eosinophil or hemoglobin measures. We did, however, find mixed and significant associations of tick burdens with lymphocyte and basophil counts, heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratios, and body condition indices. These associations varied by sex, size, and hemoparasite infection status suggesting that different life stages of iguanas may invest differently in immune responses, and impacts may be modulated based on size and sex of hosts, and coinfection status.},

	abstract = {Approximately 25,000 individuals from 150 samples of the Blue Mussel,$\backslash$nMytilus edulis, collected from Virginia to Iceland were studied at$\backslash$nsix loci. Characterization of both macro- and microgeographic variation$\backslash$nwas done in order to estimate the relative importance of migration$\backslash$nand selection to genetic differentiation among populations. Some$\backslash$nloci exhibited homogeneity in allele frequencies over very large$\backslash$ngeographic distances, while others exhibited differences over large,$\backslash$nmoderate, and very small distances. Frequencies of alleles at the$\backslash$nAP locus were uniform throughout the sampled range, with the exception$\backslash$nof northern Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Iceland. At the LAP locus$\backslash$nthe commonest allele (0.55-0.58) was uniform from Virginia to southern$\backslash$nCape Cod, excluding Long Island Sound. Within Long Island Sound,$\backslash$nthe frequency of this allele decreased along the Connecticut shore$\backslash$nwith distance from the Atlantic Ocean reaching a minimum value of$\backslash$n0.10 at New York City. North Shore of Long Island samples were all$\backslash$nless than 0.20, even within several hundred yards of the Atlantic$\backslash$nOcean. The variation in frequency is consistent with selection against$\backslash$ncertain genotypes and immigrants transported via known circulation$\backslash$npatterns into Long Island Sound. A similar sharp decrease of the$\backslash$nsame magnitude occurred north of Cape Cod. The GPI locus exhibited$\backslash$nsignificant correlation between allele frequencies and the latitude$\backslash$nfrom which samples were taken. There were no significant deviations$\backslash$nin observed zygotic frequencies from those expected at Hardy-Weinberg$\backslash$nequilibrium at the GPI locus. However, significant deviations were$\backslash$nobserved at both the AP and LAP loci in samples taken from geographic$\backslash$nareas adjacent to major regions of significantly different genetic$\backslash$ncomposition. These significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg, in$\backslash$nthe form of deficiencies of heterozygotes, are attributed at least$\backslash$npartially to the Wahlund effect. Migration does not appear to be$\backslash$na significant factor in the maintenance of the observed patterns$\backslash$nof macrogeographic variation. Attempts to find significant correlations$\backslash$nbetween magnitudes of spatial heterogeneity and genetic composition$\backslash$nand magnitudes of heterozygote deficiency of individual loci were$\backslash$nunsuccessful. Likewise, loci exhibiting significant geographic variation$\backslash$nin genetic composition could not be shown to exhbiit significantly$\backslash$ngreater deficiencies of heterozygotes. Dilocus genotypic compositions$\backslash$ndid not provide additional support for a major role of migration.$\backslash$nPopulations exposed to reductions from normal salinity, exhibit significantly$\backslash$ndifferent genetic composition, especially at the LAP locus. Multiple$\backslash$nsamples from estuaries, exhibited increased among-sample variance$\backslash$nof allele frequencies at the AP, LAP, and GPI loci. Microgeographic$\backslash$ndifferentiation was most dramatic at the LAP locus. Without exception,$\backslash$npopulations exposed to reduced salinity exhibited a significant reduction$\backslash$nin the frequency of the allele most common in marine coastal populations$\backslash$nand a concomitant increase in two alternate alleles. Significant$\backslash$nsize-dependent variation occurred in the frequency of LAP alleles$\backslash$nin some samples. Sharp spatio-temporal differences in allele frequencies$\backslash$noccurred whenever there were (1) intermediate input frequency due$\backslash$nto mixing, and (2) spatial variation in salinity. The smallest individuals$\backslash$nexhibited intermediate frequencies. Subsequent size-dependent changes$\backslash$nin allele frequency were associated with size-dependent changes in$\backslash$nheterozygosity. The direction of change in heterozygosity was dependent$\backslash$nupon the direction of change in allele frequency. These results demonstrate$\backslash$nthat despite the extended larval dispersal period of three to seven$\backslash$nweeks in this species, significant spatio-temporal variation exists$\backslash$nin genetic composition. This variation seems most likely to be determined$\backslash$nby spatial heterogeneity of the environment, possibly interactions$\backslash$nof temperature and salinity. Although significant mortality occurs$\backslash$nin the larval population, considerable differential mortality occurs$\backslash$nin adults.},

	abstract = {Avoidance of incestuous matings is widely reported across many animal taxa, and the adaptive value of such behavior is explained through inbreeding depression. However, an old and somewhat neglected theoretical result predicts that inbred matings offer another, positive effect on the inclusive fitness of parents: an individual who mates with a relative will help that relative to spread genes identical by descent. This benefit can be substantial, if the additional mating achieved by the relative does not harm his mating success otherwise, and in the context of selfing in plants the phenomenon is well known. Here, we develop a model that derives expected values of inbreeding tolerance, that is, the magnitude of inbreeding depression that is required to make individuals avoid inbreeding, for different animal life histories and parental investment patterns. We also distinguish between simultaneous and sequential mate choice, and show that inbreeding tolerance should often be remarkably high in the latter scenario in particular, although egalitarian parental care will lead to lower tolerance. There is a mismatch between theory and data: the almost complete lack of cases where individuals prefer to mate incestuously is at odds with a large overlap between the predicted range of inbreeding tolerance and estimates of inbreeding depression found in nature. We discuss four different solutions to this enigma, and suggest that inbreeding tolerance, where it is found, should not always be attributed to a simple constraint that has prevented finding any other mate.},

@article{Kolbe2004,
	abstract = {A genetic paradox exists in invasion biology: how do introduced populations, whose genetic variation has probably been depleted by population bottlenecks, persist and adapt to new conditions? Lessons from conservation genetics show that reduced genetic variation due to genetic drift and founder effects limits the ability of a population to adapt, and small population size increases the risk of extinction. Nonetheless, many introduced species experiencing these same conditions during initial introductions persist, expand their ranges, evolve rapidly and become invasive. To address this issue, we studied the brown anole, a worldwide invasive lizard. Genetic analyses indicate that at least eight introductions have occurred in Florida from across this lizard's native range, blending genetic variation from different geographic source populations and producing populations that contain substantially more, not less, genetic variation than native populations. Moreover, recently introduced brown anole populations around the world originate from Florida, and some have maintained these elevated levels of genetic variation. Here we show that one key to invasion success may be the occurrence of multiple introductions that transform among-population variation in native ranges to within-population variation in introduced areas. Furthermore, these genetically variable populations may be particularly potent sources for introductions elsewhere. The growing problem of invasive species introductions brings considerable economic and biological costs. If these costs are to be mitigated, a greater understanding of the causes, progression and consequences of biological invasions is needed.},

Herein, we evaluate the efficacy of the approach as originally intended. We show that median-joining networks (MJNs) are theoretically untenable for evolutionary inference, and that confusion has afflicted their use for over 15 years. The approach has two obvious shortcomings: its reliance on distance-based phenetics (overall similarity instead of character transformations) and the lack of rooting (no direction or history). Given that evolution involves both change and time, and the absence of rooting removes time (ancestor--descendant relationships) from the equation, the approach cannot yield defensible evolutionary interpretations. We also examine the impact of MJ analyses on evolutionary biology via an analysis of citations and conclude that the spread of MJNs through the literature is difficult to explain, especially given the availability of character-based analyses.},

All the world's main geographical regions other than Australasia and Wallacea were represented in the study, i.e. neotropical, nearctic, palaearctic, oriental and afrotropical realms. Methods We controlled the data for the area sampled and sampling effort and then tested this relationship using both cross-region conventional analysis and the independent contrasts method (to control for the effects of biogeographic historical relationships among different regions). Brooks parsimony analysis was used to construct a region cladogram based on the presence/absence of a host species and host phylogeny. Results Both cross-region and independent contrasts analyses showed a positive correlation between host species richness and flea species richness. Conventional cross-region regression under- or overestimated fleas species richness in the majority of regions. Main conclusions When the regression derived by the independent contrasts method was mapped onto the original tip data space, points that deviated significantly from the regression originated from Kenya, Mississippi and southern California (lower than expected flea richness) and Chile, Idaho, south-western California and Kyrgyzstan (higher than expected flea richness). These deviations can be explained by the environmental mediation of host-flea relationships and by a degree of environmental variety in sampled areas.},

	abstract = {Scientific research produces new knowledge, technologies, and clinical treatments that can lead to enormous returns. Often, the path from basic research to new paradigms and direct impact on society takes time. Precise quantification of scientific output in the short-term is not an easy task but is critical for evaluating scientists, laboratories, departments, and institutions. While there have been attempts to quantifying scientific output, we argue that current methods are not ideal and suffer from solvable difficulties. Here we propose criteria that a metric should have to be considered a good index of scientific output. Specifically, we argue that such an index should be quantitative, based on robust data, rapidly updated and retrospective, presented with confidence intervals, normalized by number of contributors, career stage and discipline, impractical to manipulate, and focused on quality over quantity. Such an index should be validated through empirical testing. The purpose of quantitatively evaluating scientific output is not to replace careful, rigorous review by experts but rather to complement those efforts. Because it has the potential to greatly influence the efficiency of scientific research, we have a duty to reflect upon and implement novel and rigorous ways of evaluating scientific output. The criteria proposed here provide initial steps toward the systematic development and validation of a metric to evaluate scientific output.},

	abstract = {Whether or not organisms become infected by parasites is likely to be a complex interplay between host and parasite genotypes, as well as the physiological condition of both species. Details of this interplay are very important because physiology-driven susceptibility has the potential to confound genetic coevolutionary responses. Here we concentrate on how physiological aspects of infection may interfere with genetic-based infectivity in a snail-trematode (Potamopyrgus antipodarum/Microphallus sp.) interaction by asking: (1) how does host condition affect susceptibility to infection? and (2) how does host condition affect the survival of infected individuals? We manipulated host condition by experimentally varying resources. Contrary to our expectation, host condition did not affect susceptibility to infection, suggesting that genetics are more important than physiology in this regard. However, hosts in poor condition had higher parasite-induced mortality than hosts in good condition. Taken together, these results suggest that coevolutionary interactions with parasites may depend on host condition, not by altering susceptibility, but rather by affecting the likelihood of parasite transmission.},

	abstract = {Wild endangered populations can suffer from adverse effects on fitness due to inbreeding and environmental stress. Often, both genetic and environmental stress factors may be present in populations at the same time. Therefore knowledge on the potential interactions between these factors is important for the conservation of wild populations. When measuring fitness (e.g. survival and reproductive potential) of individuals in the laboratory, and in nature, inbreeding by environment interactions are now being reported more often. The increased focus on environmental dependency of inbreeding depression will therefore enable conservation biologists to include this knowledge in the management of endangered populations in the wild. In this study, the effects of environmental stress and inbreeding on fitness are estimated in a laboratory population of Drosophila buzzatii. Random- or full-sib mating were used to generate independent replicate lines of four different inbreeding levels (F = 0, F = 0.25, F = 0.50, F = 0.672) in four different environments. The environments were thermal and dimethoate stress separately and in combination, as well as a non-stressful control environment. Two experiments were carried out to measure productivity (a multiplicative measure of fecundity and viability) using a full factorial design. In the first experiment, productivity was estimated for all lines and inbreeding levels in the environment in which flies were inbred and reared for several generations. In the second experiment, productivity of the lines reared in the control environment was tested in all four environments and for all inbreeding levels. Our results show a significant effect of inbreeding and environmental stress on productivity in both experiments and the effect increased when flies were exposed to novel environmental conditions. Productivity was not affected by the interaction between inbreeding and environmental stress when flies were tested in the environments in which they were reared, whereas there was a tendency towards a stress by inbreeding interaction when flies were exposed to novel environments. The variance and the coefficient of variation in productivity were each affected by environmental stress and inbreeding, indicating that environmental conditions as well as genetic background are important for variation in productivity. However, the two measures of variation often showed opposite trends. The results obtained in this study indicate that the environmental conditions under which inbreeding occurs are important. This is relevant for the maintenance and management of populations in captivity and in relation to reintroduction of endangered species in nature},

	abstract = {Human activities in the past few hundred years have caused enormous impacts on many ecosystems, greatly accelerating the rate of population decline and extinction. In addition to habitat alteration and destruction, the loss of genetic diversity due to reduced population size has become a major conservation issue for many imperiled species. However, the genetic effects of persistent population bottlenecks can be very different for long-lived and short-lived species when considering the time scale of centuries. To investigate the genetic effects of persistent population bottlenecks on long-lived species, we use microsatellite markers to assess the level of genetic diversity of a small ornate box turtle population that has experienced a persistent bottleneck in the past century, and compare it to a large relatively undisturbed population. The genetic signature of a recent bottleneck is detected by examining the deviation from mutation-drift equilibrium in the small population, but the bottleneck had little effect on its level of genetic diversity. Computer simulations combined with information on population structure suggest that an effective population size of 300, which results in a census population size of 700, would be required for the small population to maintain 90{\%} of the average number of alleles per locus in the next 200 years. The life history of long-lived species could mask the accelerated rate of genetic drift, making population recovery a relatively slow process. Statistical analysis of genetic data and empirical-based computer simulations can be important tools to facilitate conservation planning.},

	abstract = {We have measured the isotopes of He, Sr, Nd and Pb in a number of lava flows from the Galapagos Archipelago; the main goal is to use magmatic helium as a tracer of plume influence in the western volcanoes. Because the Galapagos lava flows are so well preserved, it is also possible to measure surface exposure ages using in situ cosmic-ray-produced 3He. The exposure ages range from {\textless}0.1 to 580 Ka, are consistent with other chronological constraints, and provide the first direct dating of these lava flows. The new age data demonstrate the utility of the technique in this important age range and show that the western Galapagos volcanoes have been erupting distinct compositions simultaneously for the last {\~{}}10 Ka. The magmatic 3He/4He ratios range from 6.9 to 27 times atmospheric (R(a)), with the highest values found on the islands of Isabela (16.8 R(a) for Vulcan Sierra Negra) and Fernandina (23 to 27 R(a)). Values from Santa Cruz are close to typical mid-ocean ridge basalt values (MORB, of {\~{}}9 R(a)) and Pinta has a 3He/4He ratio lower than MORB (6.9 R(a)). These data confirm that the plume is centered beneath Fernandina which is the most active volcano in the archipelago and is at the leading edge of plate motion. The data are consistent with previous isotopic studies, confirming extensive contributions from depleted asthenospheric or lithospheric mantle sources, especially to the central islands. The most striking aspect of the helium isotopic data is that the 3He/4He ratios decrease systematically in all directions from Fernandina. This spatial variability is assumed to reflect the contribution of the purest plume component to Fernandina magmatism, and shows that helium is a sensitive indicator of plume influence. The highest 3He/4He ratios are found in volcanoes with lowest Na2O(8) and FeO(8), which may relate to source composition as well as degree and depth of melting. An excellent correlation is observed between 3He/4He and Nb/La, suggesting that the Galapagos plume source is characterized by high concentrations of Nb (and Ta). The major and trace element correlations demonstrate that helium is controlled by silicate melting and source variations rather than degassing and/or metasomatic processes. Although lavas with radiogenic isotopic compositions tend to have higher 3He/4He, the island-wide isotopic variability cannot be explained by simple two components mixing alone. The preferred model to explain the isotopic data includes a heterogeneous plume, {\ldots}},

To test the validity of a variety of indices, we compared how well a broad range of body condition indices predicted body fat mass, percent body fat and residual fat mass in mice Mus musculus. We also compared the performance of these condition indices with the multiple regression of several morphometric variables on body fat mass, percent body fat and residual fat mass. In our study population, two ratio based condition indices -- body mass/body length and log body mass/log body length -- predicted body fat mass as well as or better than other ratio and residual indices of condition in females. In males one ratio based condition index (log body mass/log body length) and one residual index (residuals from a regression of pelvic circumference on body length) were best at predicting body fat mass. All indices were better at estimating body fat mass, and residual fat mass than at estimating percent body fat. The predictions of body fat were much better for females than for males. Multiple regressions incorporating pelvic circumference (i.e. girth at the iliac crests) were the best predictors of body fat mass, residual fat mass, and percent body fat, and these multiple regressions were better than any of the condition indices. We recommend 1) that condition be precisely defined, 2) that predictors of condition be empirically validated, 3) that pelvic circumference be considered as a potential predictor of fat content, and 4) that, in general, multiple regression be considered as an alternative to condition indices.},

	abstract = {When an individual faces the risk of a conflict, its ability to make 'correct' decisions is crucial to its fitness. Research on decision making has focused mainly on visual and acoustic signals, while chemical signals have received much less attention, despite their relevance for many species. Chemosignals can be detected in the absence of the signaller and, in the context of fighting risk, this property confers the advantage that the receiver can avoid agonistic interactions or, if they are unavoidable, that it can prepare itself for the conflict. I studied the behaviour of males of the lizard Liolaemus monticola in the laboratory when they were confronted with chemosignals of a potential opponent. During this 'pre-confrontation' stage, I tested the following predictions: (1) lizards can derive precise information from chemosignals of conspecifics, and use this to respond with precision to the perceived risk and (2) the best predictor of the receiver behaviour, and therefore the best predictor of the risk involved in the fight, is the relative fighting ability of opponents. As a measure of fighting ability, I used body size. 'Intruders' were placed in the terrarium of unfamiliar 'residents' during the absence of the latter, and their behaviours were recorded. Simple regressions were performed between the different behavioural variables and with the body sizes of intruder and resident, and with the relative difference in body sizes of opponents. The latter was the best predictor of intruder behaviour: it was negatively correlated with behaviours associated with activity (i.e. motion time), chemoexploration (i.e. number of tongue flicks) and behaviours associated with social interactions (i.e. head bobs). These results suggest that males can process information from chemosignals and decisions made during the 'pre-confrontation' stage are based on the assessment of the relative fighting abilities (i.e. relative body size) of opponents. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Author.},

The range of functions of chemical recognition would suggest that lizards should be able to discriminate many different patterns of chemical signals. We postulate that it would be ``more economical'' for lizards to discriminate only one chemical signal pattern, the one used by individuals in their self-recognition, and that signals not matching with the basic chemical pattern will not be discriminated.},

	abstract = {Data on genus and infectious by Rickettsia were retrospectively compiled from the critical review literature regarding all countries in Latin America, Caribbean islands, Portugal and Spain. We considered all Rickettsia records reported for human and/or animal hosts, and/or invertebrate hosts considered being the vector. In a few cases, when no direct detection of a given Rickettsia group or species was available for a given country, the serologic method was considered. A total of 13 Rickettsia species have been recorded in Latin America and the Caribbean. The species with the largest number of country confirmed records were Rickettsia felis (9 countries), R. prowazekii (7 countries), R. typhi (6 countries), R. rickettsii (6 countries), R. amblyommii (5 countries), and R. parkeri (4 countries). The rickettsial records for the Caribbean islands (West Indies) were grouped in only one geographical area. Both R. bellii, R. akari, and Candidatus `R. andeane' have been recorded in only 2 countries each, whereas R. massiliae, R. rhipicephali, R.monteiroi, and R. africae have each been recorded in a single country (in this case, R. africae has been recorded in nine Caribbean Islands). For El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, no specific Rickettsia has been reported so far, but there have been serological evidence of human or/and animal infection. The following countries remain without any rickettsial records: Belize, Venezuela, Guyana, Surinam, and Paraguay. In addition, except for a few islands, many Caribbean islands remain without records. A total of 12 Rickettsia species have been reported in Spain and Portugal: R. conorii, R. helvetica, R. monacensis, R. felis, R. slovaca, R. raoultii, R. sibirica, R. aeschlimannii, R. rioja, R. massiliae, R. typhi, and R. prowazekii. Amongst these Rickettsia species reported in Spain and Portugal, only R. prowazekii, R. typhi, R. felis, and R. massiliae have also been reported in Latin America. This study summarizes the current state of art on the rickettsial distribution in Latin America, Caribbean, Spain and Portugal. The data obtained allow a better understanding on rickettsial epidemiology and distribution of vector ecology.},

The following tick species (number in parentheses) were examined: Amblyomma ovale Koch (121), Amblyomma cajennense (F.) (41), Amblyomma naponense (Packard) (36), Amblyomma scalpturatum Neumann (35), Amblyomma oblongoguttatum Koch (30), Amblyomma incisum Neumann (27), Amblyomma rotundatum Koch (16), Amblyomma coelebs Neumann (10), and Amblyomma humerale Koch (6). Ticks were examined individually or in pools (2-10 ticks) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the gltA gene. The PCR-determined minimal infection rate for each tick species was A. ovale 28{\%}, A. cajennense 27{\%}, A. naponense 0{\%}, A. scalpturatum 11{\%}, A. oblongoguttatum 3{\%}, A. incisum 0{\%}, A. rotundatum 87{\%}, A. coelebs 10{\%}, and A. humerale 50{\%}. Partial sequences of the gltA gene of Rickettsia from A. ovale, A. scalpturatum, A. oblongoguttatum, A. rotundatum, and A. humerale were 99.9{\%} (349/350) identical to Rickettsia bellii. DNA sequences of PCR products from A. cajennense and A. coelebs were 100{\%} (350/350) identical to Rickettsia amblyommii. R. bellii organisms were isolated in Vero cells from A. scalpturatum, A. ovale, A. rotundatum, and A. oblongoguttatum, but only one of the isolates, cultured from A. scalpturatum, was established in continuous cell culture passage. R. amblyommii was isolated from A. cajennense and was successfully established in continuous passage in cell culture. R. amblyommii infection of Vero cells was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. This study adds South America to the known geographic distribution of R. amblyommii and reports rickettsiae in six Amblyomma species for the first time.},

Among a total of 40 A. cooperi adult ticks collected in an area of BSF endemicity in the state of S{\~{a}}o Paulo, PCR analysis detected DNA of Rickettsia bellii in 16 ticks (40{\%}), and 3 other ticks (7.5{\%}) were positive for a previously unidentified spotted-fever-group (SFG) rickettsia. Cultivation in Vero cell cultures by the shell vial technique with individual A. cooperi ticks resulted in two isolates of R. bellii and one isolate genotypically characterized as an SFG rickettsia. The two R. bellii isolates were established in Vero cell cultures in the laboratory and were confirmed to be R. bellii by molecular analysis of the gltA and 17-kDa protein-encoding genes and by electron microscopic analysis. The SFG rickettsial isolate could not be stably passaged in cell culture in the laboratory, but molecular analysis of early passages suggested that it was closely related to Rickettsia parkeri, Rickettsia africae, and Rickettsia sibirica. These results do not support the role of A. cooperi in the ecology of R. rickettsii in the area studied, but they add two more species of rickettsiae to the poorly developed list of species occurring in ticks in South America.},

In this study, we consider the consequences of this habitat usage overlap on the behaviour patterns and social structure of a threatened species. Specifically, we used focal animal samples to collect data on the Cuban rock iguana, Cyclura nubila, in six field sites. Three of these sites are subject to considerable anthropogenic habitat usage, whereas three are in relatively low anthropogenic usage areas. Individuals in high anthropogenic usage sites were more closely assembled, with more males and females sharing a smaller amount of space. These animals exhibited even more aggressive behaviour and social interactions than expected when taking into account the larger number of possible interactants. High anthropogenic usage sites also had more male-male interactions and fewer males interacting with females. We suggest that social and mating system changes have occurred. Ramifications of these recent changes in the behavioural repertoires on the long-term survival of the species are discussed. � 2003 The Zoological Society of London.},

	abstract = {As wildlife populations become smaller, the number of interacting stochastic processes which can destabilize the populations increases: genetic effects (inbreeding and loss of adaptability) and instability of the breeding structure (sex ratio imbalances, unstable age distribution, and disrupted social systems) can decrease population growth and stability. Recent analyses have shown that some populations can be very sensitive to these stochastic processes, at larger population sizes than had been suggested previously, and often in unexpected ways. Interactions among processes can reduce population viability much more so than would be assumed from consideration of isolated factors. For example, in monogamous species, random fluctuations in sex ratio will depress the mean number of breeding pairs in populations with as many as 500 adults. At low population densities, individuals may not be able to find mates, or may not encounter individuals sufficiently unrelated to be accepted as suitable mates. Inbreeding depression of demographic rates can become a significant contributor to population decline in populations with several hundred individuals, even if genetic problems are not the primary threat. Most models of genetic decay in small and fragmented populations assume demographic stability. However, when the increases in demographic fluctuations of small populations are considered, rates of loss of genetic variation and accumulation of inbreeding can be much faster than has been suggested before. These processes can be examined in detailed, individual-based PVA models. Accurate data to parameterize these models, however, are often not available. Thus, we need to interpret cautiously PVA conclusions for populations that are small, highly fragmented, or projected for many generations.},

	abstract = {Small populations lose genetic variability because of genetic drift, and inbreeding within populations can further decrease individual variability. Lower variation depresses individual fitness, resistance to disease and parasites, and flexibility in coping with environmental challenges. Lower variation decreases mean fitness of populations (population growth rates), resilience. and long-term adaptability. Genetic drift can threaten viability of populations not just by depleting variation, but also by replacing natural selection as the predominant force driving evolutionary change. Although most genetic studies use laboratory or domesticated populations, evidence is accumulating that the effects of inbreeding are at least as severe on wild animals in natural habitats. Natural selection is expected to reduce the frequency of deleterious alleles in populations that persist through bottlenecks, but as yet there is little evidence for such purging of the genetic load in mammalian populations. No species of mammal has been shown to be unaffected by inbreeding. Genetic problems are contributing to the decline and vulnerability of at least several mammalian ta,va. Genetic threats to population viability will be expressed through their effects on and interactions with demographic and ecological processes. Theoretical analyses. experimental tests, field studies, and conservation actions should recognize the fundamental interdependency of generic and non-genetic processes affecting viability of populations.},

	abstract = {It has been hypothesized that natural selection reduces the "genetic load" of deleterious alleles from populations that inbreed during bottlenecks, thereby ameliorating impacts of future inbreeding. We tested the efficiency with which natural selection purges deleterious alleles from three subspecies of Peromyscus polionotus during 10 generations of laboratory inbreeding by monitoring pairing success, litter size, viability, and growth in 3604 litters produced from 3058 pairs. In P. p. subgriseus, there was no reduction across generations in inbreeding depression in any of the fitness components. Strongly deleterious recessive alleles may have been removed previously during episodes of local inbreeding in the wild, and the residual genetic load in this population was not further reduced by selection in the lab. In P. p. rhoadsi, four of seven fitness components did show a reduction of the genetic load with continued inbreeding. The average reduction in the genetic load was as expected if inbreeding depression in this population is caused by highly deleterious recessive alleles that are efficiently removed by selection. For P. p. leucocephalus, a population that experiences periodic bottlenecks in the wild, the effect of further inbreeding in the laboratory was to exacerbate rather than reduce the genetic load. Recessive deleterious alleles may have been removed from this population during repeated bottlenecks in the wild; the population may be close to a threshold level of heterozygosity below which fitness declines rapidly. Thus, the effects of selection on inbreeding depression varied substantially among populations, perhaps due to different histories of inbreeding and selection.},

In a subdivided population, two distinct aspects of selection are important: the strength and softness of selection. Using Drosophila melanogaster, we estimated both aspects of selection for each of eight loci across two environments. These data allow us to test conflicting predictions about the factors affecting the softness of selection. First, we show that the softness of selection is not determined by ecological conditions alone. Second, we find that resource limitation makes selection stronger but does not make it softer. Third, we find that wild-type individuals tend to benefit more than mutants from being reared with competitors of low genetic quality. This means that selection is effectively "harder" on mutants than wild types. A model is presented showing that the sensitivities of mutants and wild types to local competitors differentially affect equilibrium mutation frequency and measures of load.},

	abstract = {The study of animal signals began in earnest with the publication in 1872 of Charles Darwin's The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals, which laid the basis for a comparative study of signals across all animals, including humans. Yet even before Darwin, the exceptional diversity of animal signals has gripped the attention of natural historians and laymen alike, as these signals represent some of the most striking features of the natural world. Structures such as the long ornamented tail of the peacock, the roaring sounds of howler monkeys, audible kilometers away, and the pheromone trails laid by ants to guide their nestmates to resources are each examples of animal signals (Figure 1). Indeed, because signals evolved for the purpose of communicating (Box 1), their prominence can be hard for even a casual observer to overlook. Animal signals therefore raise many scientific questions: What are their functions? What information do they transmit? How are they produced? And why did they evolve?},

The characteristics of Pogona DBP, the pattern of vitamin D metabolites derived from injected radioactive vitamin D3 and the plasma concentrations of endogenous 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in a range of iguanian lizards have been examined. The findings suggest that 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is the major metabolite of vitamin D, and that it may represent the storage form of vitamin D in these species in the same way as in mammals. High concentrations of vitamin D within iguanian embryos and egg yolks suggest a role for this compound in embryogenesis in these species, and perhaps indicates that there is a mechanism for vitamin D delivery to eggs comparable to that found in the domestic chicken.

Those under artificial lighting had a significantly lower vitamin D status than those housed exclusively outdoors, whereas the vitamin D status of Fijian iguanas that had received intermittent exposure to natural sunlight was intermediate and not significantly different from that of animals housed exclusively outdoors. However, eggs from some of these Fijian iguanas had substantially lower vitamin D content than eggs from outdoor iguanid and agamid animals. Artificial ultraviolet light, therefore, might not be an adequate substitute for natural sunlight to maintain vitamin D status of lizards. This possible inadequacy may be because either artificial ultraviolet light has a lower intensity of the wavelengths that induce vitamin D than does sunlight or the intensity of the artificial lighting is not sufficient.},

Observed phylogeographic structure in these lizards was compared to that reported for the desrt tortoise (Xerobates agassizi), whose mtDNA phylogeny demonstrates a striking genetic break at the Colorado River. Both the desert iguana and chuckwalla exhibit extensive mtDNA polymorphism, with respective genotypic divesities G = 0.963 and 0.983, close to the maximum possible value of 1.0. Individual mtDNA clones, as well as clonal assemblages defined by specific levels of genetic divergence, showed pronounced geographic localization. Nonetheless, for each species the distributions of certain clones and most major clonal groupings encompass both sides of the Colorado River valley, and hence are clearly incongruent with the phylogeographic pattern of the desert tortoise. Overall, available molecular evidence provides no indication that the intraspecific phylogenies of the southwestern U.S. herpetofauna have been concordantly shaped by a singular vicariant factor of overriding significance.},

	abstract = {A model is developed for alternate fixations of mildly deleterious and wild-type alleles arising by forward and reverse mutation in a finite population. For almost all parameter values, this gives an equilibrium load that agrees closely with the general expression derived from diffusion theory. Nearly neutral mutations with selection coefficient a few times larger than 1/(2N(e)) do the most damage by increasing the equilibrium load. The model of alternate fixations facilitates dynamical analysis of the expected load and the mean time to extinction in a population that has been suddenly reduced from a very large size to a small size. Reverse mutation can substantially improve population viability, increasing the mean time to extinction by an order of magnitude or more, but because many mutations are irreversible the effects may not be large. Populations with initially high mean fitness and small effective size, N(e) below a few hundred individuals, may be at serious risk of extinction from fixation of deleterious mutations within 10(3) to 10(4) generations.},

	abstract = {Mutation can critically affect the viability of small populations by causing inbreeding depression, by maintaining potentially adaptive genetic variation in quantitative characters, and through the erosion of fitness by accumulation of mildly detrimental mutations. I review and integrate recent empirical and theoret- ical work on spontaneous mutation and its role in population viability and conservation planning. I analyze both the maintenance ofpotentially adaptive genetic variation in quantitative characters and the role of detrimental mutations in increasing the extinction risk of small populations. Recent experiments indicate that the rate ofproduction of quasineutral, potentially adaptive genetic variance in quantitative characters is an order of magnitude smaller than the total mutational variance because mutations with large phenotypic effects tend to be strongly detrimental. This implies that, to maintain normal adaptive potential in quantitative characters under a balance between mutation and random genetic drift (or among mutation, drift, and stabilizing natural selection), the effective population size should be about 5000 rather than 500 (the Franklin- Soule number). Recent theoretical results suggest that the risk of extinction due to the fixation of mildly detri- mental mutations may be comparable in importance to environmental stochasticity and could substantially decrease the long-term viability of populations with effective sizes as large as a few thousand. These findings suggest that current recovery goals for many threatened and endangered species are inadequate to ensure long-term population viability.},

	abstract = {A procedure is outlined for estimating the minimum number of freely segregating genetic factors, nE, contributing to the difference in a quantitative character between two populations that have diverged by artificial or natural selection. If certain simple criteria are satisfied approximately on an appropriate scale of measurement, nE can be estimated by comparing the phenotypic means and variances in the two parental populations and in their F1 and F2 hybrids (and backcrosses). This generalizes the method of Wright to genetically heterogeneous (or wild) parental populations, as well as inbred lines. Standard errors of the estimates are derived for large samples. The minimum number of genes involved in producing a large difference between populations in a quantitative trait is typically estimated to be about 5 or 10, with occasional values up to 20. This strongly supports the neo-Darwinian theory that large evolutionary changes usually occur by the accumulation of multiple genetic factors with relatively small effects.},

	abstract = {In wild animal populations, the degree of inbreeding differs between species and within species between populations. Because mating with kin often results in inbreeding depression, observed inbreeding is usually regarded to be caused by limited outbreeding opportunities due to demographic factors like small population size or population substructuring. However, theory predicts inclusive benefits from mating with kin, and thus part of the observed variation in inbreeding might be due to active inbreeding preferences. Although some recent studies indeed report kin mating preferences, the evidence is still highly ambiguous. Here, we investigate inbreeding in a natural population of the West African cichlid fish Pelvicachromis taeniatus which showed clear kin mating preferences in standardized laboratory experiments but no inbreeding depression. The presented microsatellite analysis reveals that the natural population has, in comparison to two reference populations, a reduced allelic diversity (A = 3) resulting in a low heterozygosity (H(o) = 0.167) pointing to a highly inbred population. Furthermore, we found a significant heterozygote deficit not only at population (F(is) = 0.116) but also at subpopulation level (F(is) = 0.081) suggesting that inbreeding is not only a by-product of population substructuring but possibly a consequence of behavioral kin preferences.},

However, enteric bacteria may disperse great distances during food-borne outbreaks. It is unclear if such rapid long-distance dispersal events happen regularly in natural systems or if these events represent an anthropogenic exception. We characterized Salmonella enterica isolates from the feces of free-living Gal{\'{a}}pagos land and marine iguanas from five sites on four islands using serotyping and genomic fingerprinting. Each site hosted unique and nearly exclusive serovar assemblages. Genomic fingerprint analysis offered a more complex model of S. enterica biogeography, with evidence of both unique strain pools and of spatial population structuring along a geographic gradient. These findings suggest that even relatively generalist enteric bacteria may be strongly dispersal limited in a natural system with strong barriers, such as oceanic divides. Yet, these differing results seen on two typing methods also suggests that genomic variation is less dispersal limited, allowing for different ecological processes to shape biogeographical patterns of the core and flexible portions of this bacterial species' genome.},

Populations were separated by distances of 0.2 to 9.9 km. We sequenced 1182 base pairs of the mitochondrial control region and screened 13 microsatellite loci for variability. We also added data from 5 populations (397 individuals) sampled on 4 neighboring islands (Santa Cruz, Floreana, Espanola, and San Cristobal). The 5 Santa F{\'{e}} populations, revealed as genetically distinct from populations on other islands, present relatively low levels of genetic diversity, which are similar for both microsatellite (average observed heterozygosity from 0.7686 to 0.7773) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers (haplotypic and nucleotide diversity from 0.587 to 0.728 and from 0.00079 to 0.00293, respectively), and comparable with those observed in similar-sized sampling sites on other islands. There was frequency-based evidence of genetic structure between northern and southern sites on Santa F{\'{e}} (F(st) of 0.0027-0.0115 for microsatellite and 0.0447-0.2391 for mtDNA), but the 4 southern sites showed little differentiation. Most of the intra-island genetic variation was allocated within rather than between sites. There was no evidence of sex-biased dispersal or population substructuring due to lek-mating behavior, suggesting that these 2 observed behaviors are not strong enough to leave an evolutionary signal on genetic patterns in this species.},

@article{Laslett2004,
	abstract = {A novel two-stage procedure for fitting growth curves to length frequency data collected from commercial fisheries is described. The method is suitable for species in which cohorts are spawned over a limited time period, and samples of length frequency data are collected regularly (e.g. in weekly, fortnightly, or monthly time intervals) over an extended time period. In the first stage of analysis, Gaussian mixtures are fitted separately to the data for each time interval, and summary statistics (component means and standard errors) are extracted. In the second stage, parametric growth models, such as the von Bertalanffy seasonal growth curve, are fitted to the summary data. The error structure in this second stage of analysis incorporates random between-year effects, random within-year age-group effects, random within-year time-interval effects, random within-year age-group and time-interval interactions, and sampling errors. This complex error structure incorporating unbalanced crossed and nested random effects acknowledges that commercial fishing is not an exercise in random sampling, and allows for the inevitable additional sources of random variation in such an enterprise. The method is applied to South Australian southern bluefin tuna length frequency data collected from 1964 to 1989, and leads to the conclusion that juvenile tuna grew faster in the 1980s than in the 1960s, with the 1970s being a decade of highly variable growth. ?? 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

	abstract = {The genus Rhipicephalus (Acari: Ixodidae) comprises a large number of vectors of pathogens of substantial medical and veterinary concern; however, species identification based solely on morphological features is often challenging. In the present study, genetic distance within selected Rhipicephalus species (i.e., Rhipicephalus bursa, Rhipicephalus guilhoni, Rhipicephalus muhsamae, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato and Rhipicephalus turanicus), were investigated based on molecular and phylogenetic analyses of fragments of the mitochondrial 16S, 12S and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) genes, as well as of the whole sequences of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer-2 (ITS-2) region. Mean values of inter-specific genetic distance (e.g., up to 12.6{\%}, 11.1{\%} and 15.2{\%}), as well as of intra-specific genetic distance (e.g., 0.9{\%}, 0.9{\%} and 1{\%}), calculated using the Kimura-2 parameter substitution model with uniform rates among sites for 16S, 12S and cox1 genes, respectively, confirmed the differentiation of the rhipicephaline species herein examined. The molecular identification was also supported by the distinct separation of species-specific clades inferred from the phylogenetic analyses of all mitochondrial sequences. Conversely, little interspecific divergence was detected amongst ribosomal ITS-2 sequences (i.e., up to 2.8{\%}) for species belonging to the R. sanguineus complex, which resulted in the ambiguous placement of selected R. sanguineus s.l. and R. turanicus sequences in the corresponding phylogenetic tree. Results from this study confirm the suitability of mtDNA markers for the reliable identification of ticks within the Rhipicephalus genus and provide a framework for future studies of taxonomy, speciation history and evolution of this group of ticks. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Conservation genetics can be seen as the effort to influence the evolutionary process in ways that enhance the persistence of populations. Much published research in the field applies genetic sampling techniques to infer population parameters from the patterns of variation in threatened populations. The lim- ited resolution of these inferences seems to yield limited confidence which results in conservative policy recommendations. As an alternative, I suggest that conservation genetics focus on the relationships between those variables conser- vationists can control, and the probability of desirable evolutionary outcomes. This research would involve three phases -- a greater use of existing evolutionary theory; testing management options using experimental evolution; and `field trials' under an adaptive management framework. It would take a probabilistic approach that recognizes the stochasticity inherent in evolutionary change. This would allow a more nuanced approach to conservation policy than rule of thumb guidelines. Moreover, it would capitalize on the fact that evolution is a unifying theory in biology and draw on the substantial body of evolutionary knowledge that has been built up over the last half a century.},

The 1982-83 ENSO was the most severe ever recorded: there were record sea-surface temperatures, sea-levels and rainfall, and a major change in marine algal flora resulted in disappearance of most of the iguanas' preferred food species and colonization of the intertidal zone by the brown alga Giffordia mitchelliae, a species not previously recorded in Galapagos. This led to widespread starvation, with about 60{\%} of the Santa Fe population dying between March and August 1983, and similar mortality on other islands of the archipelago. Adult males and juveniles suffered the highest mortality, with 1982 hatchlings being almost completely exterminated. Body condition and growth rates were greatly depressed during ENSO, with adult growth ceasing almost entirely, but both increased again rapidly after the population crash and reached levels higher than before ENSO. There was almost no breeding in the post ENSO season (1983-84) but since then frequency of breeding, age at first breeding, and clutch size have all increased above pre-ENSO levels. It is suggested that the increases in rates of growth and reproduction are due to a reduction in competition for food after the return of normal feeding conditions at greatly reduced population density. {\textcopyright} 1990, Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Continuous inbreeding exposes deleterious recessive alleles to selection and can thereby lead to partial purging of the genetic load and reduced inbreeding depression. Purging has been well documented in experimental laboratory populations, but evidence of reduced inbreeding depression due to purging in wild populations is largely lacking. This study examines the inbreeding load associated with juvenile survival at a protected island site of a bottlenecked population of the Stewart Island robin Petroica australis rakiura. Based on a complete pedigree of the island population, we found little evidence that inbreeding coefficients explained any additional variation in juvenile survival, once demographic factors such as the effects of density, timing of fledging and age of mother were taken into account. Lethal equivalents, a standardized measure of the strength of inbreeding depression, were close to zero (B=0.24, 95{\%} CI=−1.92--1.04, n=326) and lower than that documented for an island population of a widespread congener (B=6.71, 95{\%} CI=−0.66--14.08, n=238) and for several other species for which significant inbreeding depression was detected (B=1.30--7.47). There are several reasons as to why studies can fail to detect pedigree-based inbreeding depression in wild populations, but evidence presented here of low lethal equivalents and relatively high survival of both inbred and non-inbred juveniles are consistent with a population that has undergone partial purging of its genetic load during historical population bottlenecks. Although our study does not imply a complete absence of inbreeding depression, it is one of the first studies of a wild population where weak inbreeding depression for juvenile survival appears to be associated with a prolonged bottleneck.},

We empirically quantified size-specific excretion rates of one of the most abundant fishes (gray snapper, Lutjanus griseus) in The Bahamas and combined these with surveys of fish abundance to estimate population-level excretion rates. The study was conducted across gradients of two human disturbances: overfishing and ecosystem fragmentation (estuaries bisected by roads), to evaluate how each could result in reduced population-level nutrient cycling by consumers. Mean estimated N and P excretion rates for gray snapper populations were on average 456{\%} and 541{\%} higher, respectively, in unfished sites. Ecosystem fragmentation resulted in significant reductions of recycling rates by snapper, with degree of creek fragmentation explaining 86{\%} and 72{\%} of the variance in estimated excretion for dissolved N and P, respectively. Additionally, we used nutrient limitation assays and primary producer nutrient content to provide a simple example of how marine fishery declines may affect primary production. This study provides an initial step toward integrating marine fishery declines and consumer-driven nutrient recycling to more fully understand the implications of human impacts in marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Strong evidence for a genetic basis of variation in physical performance has accumulated. Considering one of the basic tenets of evolutionary physiology--that physical performance and darwinian fitness are tightly linked--one may expect phenotypes with exceptional physiological capacities to be promoted by natural selection. Why then does physical performance remain considerably variable in human and other animal populations? Our analysis of locomotor performance in the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara) demonstrates that initial endurance (running time to exhaustion measured at birth) is indeed highly heritable, but natural selection in favour of this trait can be unexpectedly weak. A manipulation of dietary conditions unravels a proximate mechanism explaining this pattern. Fully fed individuals experience a marked reversal of performance within only one month after birth: juveniles with low endurance catch up, whereas individuals with high endurance lose their advantage. In contrast, dietary restriction allows highly endurant neonates to retain their locomotor superiority as they age. Thus, the expression of a genetic predisposition to high physical performance strongly depends on the environment experienced early in life.},

	abstract = {In order to formulate the Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection, Fisher defined the average excess and average effect of a gene substitution. Finding these notions to be somewhat opaque, some authors have recommended reformulating Fisher's ideas in terms of covariance and regression, which are classical concepts of statistics. We argue that Fisher intended his two averages to express a distinction between correlation and causation. On this view, the average effect is a specific weighted average of the actual phenotypic changes that result from physically changing the allelic states of homologous genes. We show that the statistical and causal conceptions of the average effect, perceived as inconsistent by Falconer, can be reconciled if certain relationships between the genotype frequencies and non-additive residuals are conserved. There are certain theory-internal considerations favouring Fisher's original formulation in terms of causality; for example, the frequency-weighted mean of the average effects equaling zero at each locus becomes a derivable consequence rather than an arbitrary constraint. More broadly, Fisher's distinction between correlation and causation is of critical importance to gene-trait mapping studies and the foundations of evolutionary biology.},

	abstract = {Buckmoths (Hemileuca spp.) are day-flying saturniid moths with diverse ecologies and host plants. Populations that feed on Menyanthes trifoliata, known commonly as Cryan's buckmoths, have been found in only a few bogs and fens near eastern Lake Ontario in New York and near Ottawa in Ontario, Canada. Because of their unique ecological traits, geographic isolation from other Hemileuca populations, and the small number of sites they occupy, there is concern that the Cryan's buckmoth populations are phylogenetically distinct and should be protected. The Cryan's buckmoths have not yet been taxonomically described and do not appear to have clear distinguishing morphological characters. Both molecular genetic traits (allozymes and mitochondrial DNA sequences) and an ecologically based character (host performance) were investigated to determine whether these populations possess fixed diagnostic characters signifying genetic differentiation from other eastern Hemileuca populations. Such differences would merit separate conservation management as an evolutionarily significant unit. Our studies showed that the Cryan's buckmoths clearly belong to the Hemileuca maia species group, but they could not be readily distinguished from other members of that group by means of molecular genetic techniques. There were no fixed differences in alleles or haplotypes distinguishing any of the populations or species, suggesting recent divergence. Nonetheless, in the host-plant performance experiment only the Cryan's buckmoth larvae were able to develop on M. trifoliata, a significant difference from other Hemileuca larvae tested. The Cryan's buckmoth appears to be unique in host performance and warrants protection and management us an evolutionarily significant unit. In cases such as this where groups appear to have recently diverged, investigations into ecologically significant traits may provide indicators of conservation significance as reliable as molecular genetic markers. Criterios geneticos para el establecimiento de Unidades Evolutivamente Significativas para las polillas de los pantanos Las polillas de los pantanos del genero Hemileuca spp. (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae) son diurnas con una variedad de plantas huespedes y un amplio espectro ecologico. Poblaciones de polillas que se alimentan de Menyanthes trifoliata, de nombre comun "polillas de Cryan," han sido encontradas en pantanos de solo dos lugares: cerca de la parte este del Lago Ontario y cerca de Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Dado a que poseen caracteristicas ecologicas poco comunes, a que son geograficamente aisladas de otras poblaciones de Hemileuca y a que se encuentran en pocos sitios, se cree que estas poblaciones de polillas de Cryan son filogeneticamente distintas y deben ser protegidas. Aunque fueron descubiertas hace mas de 10 anos, las Cryan polillas de todavia no han sido descritas taxonomicamente y no parecen poseer caracteristicas morfologicas distintivas. Esta investigacion utilizo, simultaneamente, pruebas geneticas moleculares (aloenzimas y secuencia de ADN mitocondrial) y ensayos ecologicos de supervivencia en plantas especificas. El objectivo fue determinar si estas poblaciones poseian suficiente singularidad genetica en relacion a otras poblaciones similares de Hemileuca, para poder evaluar si merecian medidas especiales de conservacion como Unidad Evolutiva Significativa. Estos estudios mostraron que a polillas de Cryan evidentemente pertenecen al grupo de especies Hemileuca maia, pero no pudieron ser diferenciadas de otras especies del grupo a nivel molecular. No se encontraron diferencias fijas entre alelos, que hubieran permitido distinguir entre poblaciones y especies, lo que implica una divergencia reciente. Sin embargo, se detectaron diferencias significativas respecto a la supervivencia en las plantas huespedes entre las larvas de las polillas de Cryan y las de otras especies de Hemileuca. Solo las larvas de Cryan lograron desarrollarse en M. trifoliata. Debido a que las Cryan polillas de parecen ser unicas en su capacidad de desarollo en M. trifoliata, se de erian tomar medidas de proteccion y conservacion como unidad evolutiva significativa. En casos como este, en que los grupos parecen haber divergido recientemente, puede ser que los estudios de las caracteristicas de relevancia ecologica sean indicadores confiables de la importancia de la preservacion, tal como lo son los metodos de genetica molecular utilizando marcadores neutrales.},

	abstract = {Between-population crosses may replenish genetic variation of populations, but may also result in outbreeding depression. Apart from direct effects on plant fitness, these outbreeding effects can also alter plant-herbivore interactions by influencing plant tolerance and resistance to herbivory. We investigated effects of experimental within- and between-population outbreeding on herbivore resistance, tolerance and plant fitness using plants from 13 to 19 Lychnis flos-cuculi populations. We found no evidence for outbreeding depression in resistance reflected by the amount of leaf area consumed. However, herbivore performance was greater when fed on plants from between-population compared to within-population crosses. This can reflect outbreeding depression in resistance and/or outbreeding effects on plant quality for the herbivores. The effects of type of cross on the relationship between herbivore damage and plant fitness varied among populations. This demonstrates how between-population outbreeding effects on tolerance range from outbreeding depression to outbreeding benefits among plant populations. Finally, herbivore damage strengthened the observed outbreeding effects on plant fitness in several populations. These results raise novel considerations on the impact of outbreeding on the joint evolution of resistance and tolerance, and on the evolution of multiple defence strategies.},

	abstract = {As a key factor in endemic and epidemic dynamics, the geographical distribution of viruses has been frequently interpreted in the light of their genetic histories. Unfortunately, inference of historical dispersal or migration patterns of viruses has mainly been restricted to model-free heuristic approaches that provide little insight into the temporal setting of the spatial dynamics. The introduction of probabilistic models of evolution, however, offers unique opportunities to engage in this statistical endeavor. Here we introduce a Bayesian framework for inference, visualization and hypothesis testing of phylogeographic history. By implementing character mapping in a Bayesian software that samples time-scaled phylogenies, we enable the reconstruction of timed viral dispersal patterns while accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty. Standard Markov model inference is extended with a stochastic search variable selection procedure that identifies the parsimonious descriptions of the diffusion process. In addition, we propose priors that can incorporate geographical sampling distributions or characterize alternative hypotheses about the spatial dynamics. To visualize the spatial and temporal information, we summarize inferences using virtual globe software. We describe how Bayesian phylogeography compares with previous parsimony analysis in the investigation of the influenza A H5N1 origin and H5N1 epidemiological linkage among sampling localities. Analysis of rabies in West African dog populations reveals how virus diffusion may enable endemic maintenance through continuous epidemic cycles. From these analyses, we conclude that our phylogeographic framework will make an important asset in molecular epidemiology that can be easily generalized to infer biogeogeography from genetic data for many organisms.},

	abstract = {Research aimed at understanding the geographic context of evolutionary histories is burgeoning across biological disciplines. Recent endeavors attempt to interpret contemporaneous genetic variation in the light of increasingly detailed geographical and environmental observations. Such interest has promoted the development of phylogeographic inference techniques that explicitly aim to integrate such heterogeneous data. One promising development involves reconstructing phylogeographic history on a continuous landscape. Here, we present a Bayesian statistical approach to infer continuous phylogeographic diffusion using random walk models while simultaneously reconstructing the evolutionary history in time from molecular sequence data. Moreover, by accommodating branch-specific variation in dispersal rates, we relax the most restrictive assumption of the standard Brownian diffusion process and demonstrate increased statistical efficiency in spatial reconstructions of overdispersed random walks by analyzing both simulated and real viral genetic data. We further illustrate how drawing inference about summary statistics from a fully specified stochastic process over both sequence evolution and spatial movement reveals important characteristics of a rabies epidemic. Together with recent advances in discrete phylogeographic inference, the continuous model developments furnish a flexible statistical framework for biogeographical reconstructions that is easily expanded upon to accommodate various landscape genetic features.},

	abstract = {We studied the importance of proper model assumption in the context of Bayesian phylogenetics by examining {\textgreater}5,000 Bayesian analyses and six nested models of nucleotide substitution. Model misspecification can strongly bias bipartition posterior probability estimates. These biases were most pronounced when rate heterogeneity was ignored. The type of bias seen at a particular bipartition appeared to be strongly influenced by the lengths of the branches surrounding that bipartition. In the Felsenstein zone, posterior probability estimates of bipartitions were biased when the assumed model was underparameterized but were unbiased when the assumed model was overparameterized. For the inverse Felsenstein zone, however, both underparameterization and overparameterization led to biased bipartition posterior probabilities, although the bias caused by overparameterization was less pronounced and disappeared with increased sequence length. Model parameter estimates were also affected by model misspecification. Underparameterization caused a bias in some parameter estimates, such as branch lengths and the gamma shape parameter, whereas overparameterization caused a decrease in the precision of some parameter estimates. We caution researchers to assure that the most appropriate model is assumed by employing both a priori model choice methods and a posteriori model adequacy tests.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The PCR-based analysis of homologous genes has become one of the most powerful approaches for species detection and identification, particularly with the recent availability of Next Generation Sequencing platforms (NGS) making it possible to identify species composition from a broad range of environmental samples. Identifying species from these samples relies on the ability to match sequences with reference barcodes for taxonomic identification. Unfortunately, most studies of environmental samples have targeted ribosomal markers, despite the fact that the mitochondrial Cytochrome c Oxidase subunit I gene (COI) is by far the most widely available sequence region in public reference libraries. This is largely because the available versatile (" universal" ) COI primers target the 658 barcoding region, whose size is considered too large for many NGS applications. Moreover, traditional barcoding primers are known to be poorly conserved across some taxonomic groups.Results: We first design a new PCR primer within the highly variable mitochondrial COI region, the " mlCOIintF" primer. We then show that this newly designed forward primer combined with the " jgHCO2198" reverse primer to target a 313 bp fragment performs well across metazoan diversity, with higher success rates than versatile primer sets traditionally used for DNA barcoding (i.e. LCO1490/HCO2198). Finally, we demonstrate how the shorter COI fragment coupled with an efficient bioinformatics pipeline can be used to characterize species diversity from environmental samples by pyrosequencing. We examine the gut contents of three species of planktivorous and benthivorous coral reef fish (family: Apogonidae and Holocentridae). After the removal of dubious COI sequences, we obtained a total of 334 prey Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) belonging to 14 phyla from 16 fish guts. Of these, 52.5{\%} matched a reference barcode ({\textgreater}98{\%} sequence similarity) and an additional 32{\%} could be assigned to a higher taxonomic level using Bayesian assignment.Conclusions: The molecular analysis of gut contents targeting the 313 COI fragment using the newly designed mlCOIintF primer in combination with the jgHCO2198 primer offers enormous promise for metazoan metabarcoding studies. We believe that this primer set will be a valuable asset for a range of applications from large-scale biodiversity assessments to food web studies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Leray et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

This extends the Ewens formula for the configuration of a random sample to the case where the sample is drawn from a population of small size, that is, without the usual large-N and small-mutation-rate assumption. The formula is used to prove a conjecture ascertaining the validity of a diffusion approximation for the frequency of a mutant-type allele under weak selection in segregation with a wild-type allele in the limit finite-island model, namely, a population that is subdivided into a finite number of demes of size N and that receives an expected fraction m of migrants from a common migrant pool each generation, as the number of demes goes to infinity. This is done by applying the formula to the migrant ancestors of a single deme and sampling their types at random. The proof of the conjecture confirms an analogy between the island model and a random-mating population, but with a different timescale that has implications for estimation procedures.},

	abstract = {Diffusion approximations are ascertained from a two-time-scale argument in the case of a group-structured diploid population with scaled viability parameters depending on the individual genotype and the group type at a single multi-allelic locus under recurrent mutation, and applied to the case of random pairwise interactions within groups. The main step consists in proving global and uniform convergence of the distribution of the group types in an infinite population in the absence of selection and mutation, using a coalescent approach. An inclusive fitness formulation with coefficient of relatedness between a focal individual J affecting the reproductive success of an individual I, defined as the expected fraction of genes in I that are identical by descent to one or more genes in J in a neutral infinite population, given that J is allozygous or autozygous, yields the correct selection drift functions. These are analogous to the selection drift functions obtained with pure viability selection in a population with inbreeding. They give the changes of the allele frequencies in an infinite population without mutation that correspond to the replicator equation with fitness matrix expressed as a linear combination of a symmetric matrix for allozygous individuals and a rank-one matrix for autozygous individuals. In the case of no inbreeding, the mean inclusive fitness is a strict Lyapunov function with respect to this deterministic dynamics. Connections are made between dispersal with exact replacement (proportional dispersal), uniform dispersal, and local extinction and recolonization. The timing of dispersal (before or after selection, before or after mating) is shown to have an effect on group competition and the effective population size.},

	abstract = {Fragmentation can strongly influence population persistence and expression of life-history strategies in spatially-structured populations. In this study, we directly estimated size-specific dispersal, growth, and survival of stream-dwelling brook trout in a stream network with connected and naturally-isolated tributaries. We used multiple-generation, individual-based data to develop and parameterize a size-class and location-based population projection model, allowing us to test effects of fragmentation on population dynamics at local (i.e., subpopulation) and system-wide (i.e., metapopulation) scales, and to identify demographic rates which influence the persistence of isolated and fragmented populations. In the naturally-isolated tributary, persistence was associated with higher early juvenile survival ( approximately 45{\%} greater), shorter generation time (one-half) and strong selection against large body size compared to the open system, resulting in a stage-distribution skewed towards younger, smaller fish. Simulating barriers to upstream migration into two currently-connected tributary populations caused rapid (2-6 generations) local extinction. These local extinctions in turn increased the likelihood of system-wide extinction, as tributaries could no longer function as population sources. Extinction could be prevented in the open system if sufficient immigrants from downstream areas were available, but the influx of individuals necessary to counteract fragmentation effects was high (7-46{\%} of the total population annually). In the absence of sufficient immigration, a demographic change (higher early survival characteristic of the isolated tributary) was also sufficient to rescue the population from fragmentation, suggesting that the observed differences in size distributions between the naturally-isolated and open system may reflect an evolutionary response to isolation. Combined with strong genetic divergence between the isolated tributary and open system, these results suggest that local adaptation can 'rescue' isolated populations, particularly in one-dimensional stream networks where both natural and anthropogenically-mediated isolation is common.

The assembled contigs (2.25 gigabases (Gb)) cover approximately 94{\%} of the whole genome, and the remaining gaps (0.05 Gb) seem to contain carnivore-specific repeats and tandem repeats. Comparisons with the dog and human showed that the panda genome has a lower divergence rate. The assessment of panda genes potentially underlying some of its unique traits indicated that its bamboo diet might be more dependent on its gut microbiome than its own genetic composition. We also identified more than 2.7 million heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the diploid genome. Our data and analyses provide a foundation for promoting mammalian genetic research, and demonstrate the feasibility for using next-generation sequencing technologies for accurate, cost-effective and rapid de novo assembly of large eukaryotic genomes.},

	abstract = {The nucleotide sequence of the complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecule of the salt-water crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) was determined in this article. The molecule is 16,917 base pairs (bp) in length, and codes for 22 tRNAs, 13 protein- coding genes, 2 rRNAs, as well as a control region (D-loop), as is characteristic for mitochondrial genomes of other metazoans. The gene order conforms to that of other crocodilians sequenced, but the arrangement of some tRNA genes differs from other vertebrates. It shows that the gene order of crocodilians is remarkably conserved. In this study, the relationships among crocodilians were examined in the phylogenetic analysis based on the control conserved regions of 17 crocodilians. The results suggest that the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) joins the false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) on a common branch, and then constitutes a sister group to traditional Crocodylidae. Thus, the result supports that G. gangeticus belongs to Crocodylidae. The analyses also suggest that the African slender-snouted crocodile (Crocodylus cataphractus) can be treated as an isolated genus, and constitutes a sister group to Crocodylus.},

	abstract = {Being able to accurately estimate the persistence time of populations of endangered plants and animals is central to conservation biology and is of considerable importance in informing land-use decisions. Genetic deterioration (due to inbreeding and random genetic drift) and environmental deterioration (e.g. climate change, pollution and introduced species) clearly contribute to population extinction, however, considerable recent evidence suggests that interactions between genetic deterioration and environmental stress are ubiquitous. The importance of these interactions for potentially reducing persistence times has not been quantified and has not been taken into account by major conservation organizations. Using a computer simulation, we determined that including reasonable estimates of the inbreeding--environment interaction reduces persistence times by 17.5--28.5{\%} (mean=23{\%}) for a wide range of carrying capacities, assumptions concerning the number of lethal equivalents and different regimes for the frequency and magnitude of the stressful environment. We note that the proportional decrease in persistence time with inclusion of the interactions becomes larger (i.e. the interaction becomes more important) as absolute time to extinction gets larger. Thus, inclusion of the interaction is important and surprisingly may be most needed when populations are of intermediate size and are considered relatively safe from environmental and genetic stresses acting independently.},

In a small, naturally restored, wild population of grey wolves in Scandinavia, founded in 1983, we constructed a pedigree for 24 of the 28 breeding pairs established in the period 1983-2002. Ancestry for the breeding animals was determined through a combination of field data (snow tracking and radio telemetry) and DNA microsatellite analysis. The population was founded by only three individuals. The inbreeding coefficient F varied between 0.00 and 0.41 for wolves born during the study period. The number of surviving pups per litter during their first winter after birth was strongly correlated with inbreeding coefficients of pups (R2=0.39, p{\textless}0.001). This inbreeding depression was recalculated to match standard estimates of lethal equivalents (2B), corresponding to 6.04 (2.58-9.48, 95{\%} CI) litter-size-reducing equivalents in this wolf population.},

A large variety of theoretical models have attempted to understand how local dispersal may shape the coevolution of interacting species such as host-parasite interactions. The lack of a unifying framework is a serious impediment for anyone willing to understand current theory. Here, we review previous theoretical studies in the light of a single epidemiological model that allows us to explore the effects of both host and parasite migration rates on the evolution and coevolution of various life-history traits. We discuss the impact of local dispersal on parasite virulence, various host defence strategies and local adaptation. Our analysis shows that evolutionary and coevolutionary outcomes crucially depend on the details of the host-parasite life cycle and on which life-history trait is involved in the interaction. We also discuss experimental studies that support the effects of spatial structure on the evolution of host-parasite interactions. This review highlights major similarities between some theoretical results, but it also reveals an important gap between evolutionary and coevolutionary models. We discuss possible ways to bridge this gap within a more unified framework that would reconcile spatial epidemiology, evolution and coevolution.},

To determine the drivers of evolution in this species, 225 individuals belonging to 15 populations from different geographic locations were sampled, and population genetics was studied using high-throughput genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). Based on genetic diversity analysis, phylogenetic analysis, principal component analysis, and structure analysis, 15 natural populations were clustered into the following five subgroups: subgroup I (Shigatse subgroup) was located in the upper reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River with a relatively high level of population genetic variation (means for PIC, Shannon and PI were 0.173, 0.326 and 0.0000305, respectively), and gene flow within the subgroup was also high (mean value for Nm was 4.67). Subgroup II (including Pop 7 and Pop 8; means for PIC, Shannon and PI were 0.182, 0.345 and 0.0000321, respectively), located in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River had relatively high levels of gene flow with the populations distributed in the upper and lower reaches. The Nm between subgroup II with subgroups I and III was 3.271 and 2.894, respectively. Considering all the genetic diversity indices Pop 8 had relatively high genetic diversity. Subgroup III (the remaining mixed subgroup of Lhasa and Shannan) was located in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River and the means for PIC, Shannon and PI were 0.172, 0.324 and 0.0000303, respectively. Subgroup IV (Nyingchi subgroup), located in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River basin, showed a further genetic distance from the other subgroups and the means for PIC, Shannon and PI were 0.147, 0.277 and 0.0000263, respectively. Subgroup V (Nyingchi Gongbu Jiangda subgroup), located in the upper reaches of the Niyang River, had the lowest level of genetic variation (means for PIC, Shannon and PI were 0.106, 0.198 and 0.0000187, respectively) and gene flow with other populations (mean value for Nm was 0.42). According to the comprehensive analysis, the S. moorcroftiana populations generally expanded from upstream to downstream and displayed a high level of genetic differentiation in the populations in the upper and lower reaches. There were high levels of gene exchange between the central populations with upstream and downstream populations, and wind-induced seed dispersal was an important factor in the formation of this gene exchange mode.},

Absolute quantification determines the input copy number, usually by relating the PCR signal to a standard curve. Relative quantification relates the PCR signal of the target transcript in a treatment group to that of another sample such as an untreated control. The 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method is a convenient way to analyze the relative changes in gene expression from real-time quantitative PCR experiments. The purpose of this report is to present the derivation, assumptions, and applications of the 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method. In addition, we present the derivation and applications of two variations of the 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method that may be useful in the analysis of real-time, quantitative PCR data.},

@article{Lohr2015,
	abstract = {Reduced population size is thought to have strong consequences for evolutionary processes as it enhances the strength of genetic drift. In its interaction with selection, this is predicted to increase the genetic load, reduce inbreeding depression, and increase hybrid vigor, and in turn affect phenotypic evolution. Several of these predictions have been tested, but comprehensive studies controlling for confounding factors are scarce. Here, we show that populations of Daphnia magna, which vary strongly in genetic diversity, also differ in genetic load, inbreeding depression, and hybrid vigor in a way that strongly supports theoretical predictions. Inbreeding depression is positively correlated with genetic diversity (a proxy for Ne), and genetic load and hybrid vigor are negatively correlated with genetic diversity. These patterns remain significant after accounting for potential confounding factors and indicate that, in small populations, a large proportion of the segregation load is converted into fixed load. Overall, the results suggest that the nature of genetic variation for fitness-related traits differs strongly between large and small populations. This has large consequences for evolutionary processes in natural populations, such as selection on dispersal, breeding systems, ageing, and local adaptation.},

Fingerprint patterns for 42 individuals were obtained by digesting genomic crane DNAs with HaeIII followed by electrophoresis, blotting, and hybridization to the M13 satellite probe. Despite finding reduced levels of genetic variation in the Whooping Crane due to a population "bottleneck," these polymorphisms were successfully used to determine paternity in six of seven cases of captive propagation where the maternal-offspring relationship was known, but where the sire was unknown. These determinations of paternity are required for effective genetic management of the crane flock. These results also revealed a number of heterozygous minisatellite loci that will be valuable in future assessments of genetic variability in this endangered species.},

@article{Losos2010,
	abstract = {Adaptive radiation refers to diversification from an ancestral species that produces descendants adapted to use a great variety of distinct ecological niches. In this review, I examine two aspects of adaptive radiation: first, that it results from ecological opportunity and, second, that it is deterministic in terms of its outcome and evolutionary trajectory. Ecological opportunity is usually a prerequisite for adaptive radiation, although in some cases, radiation can occur in the absence of preexisting opportunity. Nonetheless, many clades fail to radiate although seemingly in the presence of ecological opportunity; until methods are developed to identify and quantify ecological opportunity, the concept will have little predictive utility in understanding a priori when a clade might be expected to radiate. Although predicted by theory, replicated adaptive radiations occur only rarely, usually in closely related and poorly dispersing taxa found in the same region on islands or in lakes. Contingencies of a variety of types may usually preclude close similarity in the outcome of evolutionary diversification in other situations. Whether radiations usually unfold in the same general sequence is unclear because of the unreliability of methods requiring phylogenetic reconstruction of ancestral events. The synthesis of ecological, phylogenetic, experimental, and genomic advances promises to make the coming years a golden age for the study of adaptive radiation; natural history data, however, will always be crucial to understanding the forces shaping adaptation and evolutionary diversification.},

	abstract = {Charles Darwin's travels on HMS Beagle taught him that islands are an important source of evidence for evolution. Because many islands are young and have relatively few species, evolutionary adaptation and species proliferation are obvious and easy to study. In addition, the geographical isolation of many islands has allowed evolution to take its own course, free of influence from other areas, resulting in unusual faunas and floras, often unlike those found anywhere else. For these reasons, island research provides valuable insights into speciation and adaptive radiation, and into the relative importance of contingency and determinism in evolutionary diversification.},

These epidermal glands are described as glandular scales that overlay the femoral glands and are included in the normal epidermal profile located in the femoral (thigh) and anterior antebrachial (fore-leg) regions of the male sungazer. GC-MS analysis of the generation gland secretions and the trimethylsilyl derivatives of some of the steroidal constituents was employed to identify 59 constituents, including alkenes, carboxylic acids, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, esters, amides, nitriles, and steroids. The quantitative differences of the volatile constituents of the fore- and hind-leg generation glands were compared between individuals.

We investigated genetic variability among 17 wild-rice populations in northern Wisconsin using 13 isozyme markers. We then compared these genetic patterns to differences in habitat and population characteristics and phenotypic variation in plant growth and reproduction across sites. Wild-rice's mean genetic diversity (0.15) is moderate compared to wind-pollinated outcrossers but lower than the mean (0.20) reported for the Poaceae. Estimated inbreeding coefficients within populations (f) average 0.12 but vary greatly among the populations (from -0.44-0.52), suggesting heterogeneous population histories. Larger populations in larger lakes express higher levels of genetic variability and smaller inbreeding coefficients than smaller or more isolated populations. The number of panicles per plant is also higher in populations with greater genetic variability. Estimated genetic differentiation among the 17 populations (F(ST)) was high (0.30), suggesting limited gene flow among drainages. Wild-rice population size and degree of isolation have opposing effects on its genetic variability, and plant performance is positively associated with genetic variability.},

Captive propagation efforts for E. nana were initiated in 1996 to maintain a captive population for restocking in the event that E. nana becomes extinct. We surveyed DNA sequence data for a mitochondrial and a nuclear gene region (ND4 and rag1) and 281 AFLP markers to obtain baseline data on the level of genetic diversity across the known range of E. nana and to test for population subdivision within its restricted range. Next, we compared levels of genetic variation between E. nana in the wild and captive-born individuals from the captive population to assess the efficacy of the captive breeding program. We investigated inbreeding in the captive population by testing for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at the rag1 locus for captive-born individuals. The level of genetic diversity detected in wild E. nana was similar to that of other Eurycea populations in central Texas, and we found no evidence of population structure across the range of E. nana. The surveyed captive-born E. nana contained reduced genetic diversity at some loci, but similar genetic diversity at others relative to the wild, and there was no evidence of inbreeding within the wild-caught individuals that sired these captive-born individuals. The data we have obtained regarding the level of genetic variation in wild E. nana and in the captive population will provide baseline information for this species.},

	abstract = {We use population genetics theory and computer simulations to demonstrate that population bottlenecks cause a characteristic mode-shift distortion in the distribution of allele frequencies at selectively neutral loci. Bottlenecks cause alleles at low frequency ({\textless} 0.1) to become less abundant than alleles in one or more intermediate allele frequency class (e.g., 0.1-0.2). This distortion is transient and likely to be detectable for only a few dozen generations. Consequently only recent bottlenecks are likely to be detected by tests for distortions in distributions of allele frequencies. We illustrate and evaluate a qualitative graphical method for detecting a bottleneck-induced distortion of allele frequency distributions. The simple novel method requires no information on historical population sizes or levels of genetic variation; it requires only samples of 5 to 20 polymorphic loci and approximately 30 individuals. The graphical method often differentiates between empirical datasets from bottlenecked and nonbottlenecked natural populations. Computer simulations show that the graphical method is likely (P {\textgreater} .80) to detect an allele frequency distortion after a bottleneck of {\textless} or = 20 breeding individuals when 8 to 10 polymorphic microsatellite loci are analyzed.},

	abstract = {A sign test for heterozygosity excess has been developed for detecting recent historical bottlenecks using allele frequencies of 5-20 polymorphic loci in a sample of 20-30 individuals. The reliability of this test was evaluated by analysing 56 allozyme and 37 microsatellite data sets from bottlenecked and non-bottlenecked natural populations [details of individual populations are presented in appendices I-III of the paper]. In the bottlenecked populations, 10 of 11 microsatellite data sets and 6 of 10 allozyme data sets had significant heterozygosity excess. None of the 46 allozyme data sets and 7 of the 26 microsatellite data sets from non-bottlenecked populations had a significant heterozygosity excess (P{\textless}0.05). 18 non-bottlenecked populations showed a significant deficiency of heterozygosity, indicating a recent expansion in population size or an influx of rare alleles from genetically distinct immigrants. Generally, analysis of the data sets under the stepwise mutation model gave a lower number of populations with heterozygosity excess than were obtained using the infinite allele model. It is concluded that the test can be used to detect small bottlenecks when at least 5 polymorphic loci and 20-30 individuals are analysed},

	abstract = {It is important to detect population bottlenecks in threatened and managed species because bottlenecks can increase the risk of population extinction. Early detection is critical and can be facilitated by statistically powerful monitoring programs for detecting bottleneck-induced genetic change. We used Monte Carlo computer simulations to evaluate the power of the following tests for detecting genetic changes caused by a severe reduction in a population's effective size (Ne): a test for loss of heterozygosity, two tests for loss of alleles, two tests for change in the distribution of allele frequencies, and a test for small Ne based on variance in allele frequencies (the 'variance test'). The variance test was most powerful; it provided an 85{\%} probability of detecting a bottleneck of size Ne = 10 when monitoring five microsatellite loci and sampling 30 individuals both before and one generation after the bottleneck. The variance test was almost 10-times more powerful than a commonly used test for loss of heterozygosity, and it allowed for detection of bottlenecks before 5{\%} of a population's heterozygosity had been lost. The second most powerful tests were generally the tests for loss of alleles. However, these tests had reduced power for detecting genetic bottlenecks caused by skewed sex ratios. We provide guidelines for the number of loci and individuals needed to achieve high-power tests when monitoring via the variance test. We also illustrate how the variance test performs when monitoring loci that have widely different allele frequency distributions as observed in five wild populations of mountain sheep (Ovis canadensis).},

	abstract = {Insect mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) genes are used as a model to examine the withingene heterogeneity of evolutionary rate and its implications for evolutionary analyses. The complete sequence (1537 bp) of the meadow grasshopper (Chorthippus parallelus) COI gene has been determined, and compared with eight other insect COI genes at both the DNA and amino acid sequence levels. This reveals that different regions evolve at different rates, and the patterns of sequence variability seems associated with functional constraints on the protein. The COOH-terminal was found to be significantly more variable than internal loops (I), external loops (E), transmembrane helices (M) or the NH2 terminal. The central region of COI (M5-M8) has lower levels of sequence variability, which is related to several important functional domains in this region. Highly conserved primers which amplify regions of different variabilities have been designed to cover the entire insect COI gene. These primers have been shown to amplify COI in a wide range of species, representing all the major insect groups; some even in an arachnid. Implications of the observed evolutionary pattern for phylogenetic analysis are discussed, with particular regard to the choice of regions of suitable variability for specific phylogenetic projects.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the impacts of inbreeding and genetic drift on fitness traits in fragmented populations is becoming a major goal in conservation biology. Such impacts occur at different levels and involve different sets of loci. Genetic drift randomly fixes slightly deleterious alleles leading to different fixation load among populations. By contrast, inbreeding depression arises from highly deleterious alleles in segregation within a population and creates variation among individuals. A popular approach is to measure correlations between molecular variation and phenotypic performances. This approach has been mainly used at the individual level to detect inbreeding depression within populations and sometimes at the population level but without consideration about the genetic processes measured. For the first time, we used in this study a molecular approach considering both the interpopulation and intrapopulation level to discriminate the relative importance of inbreeding depression vs. fixation load in isolated and non-fragmented populations of European tree frog (Hyla arborea), complemented with interpopulational crosses. We demonstrated that the positive correlations observed between genetic heterozygosity and larval performances on merged data were mainly caused by co-variations in genetic diversity and fixation load among populations rather than by inbreeding depression and segregating deleterious alleles within populations. Such a method is highly relevant in a conservation perspective because, depending on how populations lose fitness (inbreeding vs. fixation load), specific management actions may be designed to improve the persistence of populations.},

	abstract = {Background: The 5' region of cytochrome oxidase I (COI) is the standard marker for DNA barcoding. However, COI has proved to be of limited use in identifying some species, and for some taxa, the coding sequence is not efficiently amplified by PCR. These deficiencies lead to uncertainty as to whether COI is the most suitable barcoding fragment for species identification of ticks. Methods: In this study, we directly compared the relative effectiveness of COI, 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and 12S rDNA for tick species identification. A total of 307 sequences from 84 specimens representing eight tick species were acquired by PCR. Besides the 1,834 published sequences of 189 tick species from GenBank and the Barcode of Life Database, 430 unpublished sequences representing 59 tick species were also successfully screened by Bayesian analyses. Thereafter, the performance of the four DNA markers to identify tick species was evaluated by identification success rates given by these markers using nearest neighbour (NN), BLASTn, liberal tree-based or liberal tree-based (+threshold) methods. Results: Genetic divergence analyses showed that the intra-specific divergence of each marker was much lower than the inter-specific divergence. Our results indicated that the rates of correct sequence identification for all four markers (COI, 16S rDNA, ITS2, 12S rDNA) were very high ({\textgreater} 96{\%}) when using the NN methodology. We also found that COI was not significantly better than the other markers in terms of its rate of correct sequence identification. Overall, BLASTn and NN methods produced higher rates of correct species identification than that produced by the liberal tree-based methods (+threshold or otherwise). Conclusions: As the standard DNA barcode, COI should be the first choice for tick species identification, while 16S rDNA, ITS2, and 12S rDNA could be used when COI does not produce reliable results. Besides, NN and BLASTn are efficient methods for species identification of ticks. Keywords: DNA Barcode, COI, Species identification, Ticks, 16S rDNA, ITS2, 12S rDNA, Nearest neighbour, BLASTn},

	abstract = {We define co-introduced parasites as those which have been transported with an alien host to a new locality, outside of their natural range, and co-invading parasites as those which have been co-introduced and then spread to new, native hosts. Of 98 published studies of co-introductions, over 50{\%} of hosts were freshwater fishes and 49{\%} of parasites were helminths. Although we would expect parasites with simple, direct life cycles to be much more likely to be introduced and establish in a new locality, a substantial proportion (36{\%}) of co-introductions were of parasites with an indirect life cycle. Seventy-eight per cent of co-introduced parasites were found in native host species and can therefore be classed as co-invaders. Host switching was equally common among parasites with direct and indirect life cycles. The magnitude of the threat posed to native species by co-invaders will depend, among other things, on parasite virulence. In 16 cases where co-introduced parasites have switched to native hosts and information was available on relative virulence, 14 (85{\%}) were more virulent in native hosts than in the co-introduced alien host. We argue that this does not necessarily support the na{\"{i}}ve host theory that co-invading parasites will have greater pathogenic effects in native hosts with which they have no coevolutionary history, but may instead be a consequence of the greater likelihood for parasites with lower virulence in their natural host to be co-introduced. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

	abstract = {-Previous attempts to model the joint action of selection and mutation in finite popu- lations have treated population size as being independent of the mutation load. However, the accumulation of deleterious mutations is expected to cause a gradual reduction in population size. Consequently, in small populations random genetic drift will progressively overpower selection making it easier to fix future mutations. This synergistic interaction, which we refer to as a mu- tational melt-down, ultimately leads to population extinction. For many conditions, the coefficient of variation of extinction time is less than 0.1, and for species that reproduce by binary fission, the expected extinction time is quite insensitive to population carrying capacity. These results are consistent with observations that many cultures of ciliated protozoans and vertebrate fibroblasts have characteristic extinction times. The model also predicts that clonal lineages are unlikely to survive more than 104 to 105 generations, which is consistent with existing data on parthenogenetic animals. Contrary to the usual view that Muller's ratchet does more damage when selection is weak, we show that the mean extinction time declines as mutations become more deleterious. Although very small sexual populations, such as self-fertilized lines, are subject to mutational melt- downs, recombination effectively eliminates the process when the effective population size exceeds a dozen or so. The concept of the effective mutation load is developed, and several procedures for estimating it are described. It is shown that this load can be reduced substantially when mutational effects are highly variable.},

	abstract = {Estimates of genetic effective population size (Ne) using molecular markers are a potentially useful tool for the management of endangered through to commercial species. But, pitfalls are predicted when the effective size is large, as estimates require large numbers of samples from wild populations for statistical validity. Our simulations showed that linkage disequilibrium estimates of Ne up to 10,000 with finite confidence limits can be achieved with sample sizes around 5000. This was deduced from empirical allele frequencies of seven polymorphic microsatellite loci in a commercially harvested fisheries species, the narrow barred Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commerson). As expected, the smallest standard deviation of Ne estimates occurred when low frequency alleles were excluded. Additional simulations indicated that the linkage disequilibrium method was sensitive to small numbers of genotypes from cryptic species or conspecific immigrants. A correspondence analysis algorithm was developed to detect and remove outlier genotypes that could possibly be inadvertently sampled from cryptic species or non-breeding immigrants from genetically separate populations. Simulations demonstrated the value of this approach in Spanish mackerel data. When putative immigrants were removed from the empirical data, 95{\%} of the Ne estimates from jacknife resampling were above 24,000.},

	abstract = {Divergence in communication systems should influence the likelihood that individuals from different lineages interbreed, and consequently shape the direction and rate of hybridization. Here, we studied the role of chemical communication in hybridization, and its contribution to asymmetric and sexually selected introgression between two lineages of the common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis). Males of the two lineages differed in the chemical composition of their femoral secretions. Chemical profiles provided information regarding male secondary sexual characters, but the associations were variable and inconsistent between lineages. In experimental contact zones, chemical composition was weakly associated with male reproductive success, and did not predict the likelihood of hybridization. Consistentwith these results, introgression of chemical profiles in a natural hybrid zone resembled that of neutral nuclear genetic markers overall, but one compound in particular (tocopherol methyl ether) matched closely the introgression of visual sexual characters. These results imply that associations among male chemical profiles, sexual characters, and reproductive success largely reflect transient and environmentally driven effects, and that genetic divergence in chemical composition is largely neutral. We therefore suggest that femoral secretions in wall lizards primarily provide information about residency and individual identity rather than function as sexual signals},

	abstract = {The effects of the direct interaction between hybridization and speciation-two major contrasting evolutionary processes--are poorly understood. We present here the evolutionary history of the Gal{\'{a}}pagos marine iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) and reveal a case of incipient within--island speciation, which is paralleled by between-island hybridization. In-depth genome-wide analyses suggest that Amblyrhynchus diverged from its sister group, the Gal{\'{a}}pagos land iguanas, around 4.5 million years ago (Ma), but divergence among extant populations is exceedingly young (less than 50,000 years). Despite Amblyrhynchus appearing as a single long-branch species phylogenetically, we find strong population structure between islands, and one case of incipient speciation of sister lineages within the same island--ostensibly initiated by volcanic events. Hybridization between both lineages is exceedingly rare, yet frequent hybridization with migrants from nearby islands is evident. The contemporary snapshot provided by highly variable markers indicates that speciation events may have occurred throughout the evolutionary history of marine iguanas, though these events are not visible in the deeper phylogenetic trees.

From the point of view of conservation strategies, it is not only the effect of genetic factors on population decline that needs to be considered, but also whether introducing novel genes can prevent or reverse such a decline. Here we show that the introduction of new genes into a severely inbred and isolated population of adders (Vipera berus) halted its precipitous decline towards extinction and expanded the population dramatically.},

The introduction significantly enhanced the population's genetic variability, which resulted in a dramatic increase in offspring viability and a rapid increase in numbers. Unfortunately, recently a new and unprecedented development is threatening the population's future survival. In 2004 permission was granted by the Swedish Nature Conservation Agency of the County Administrative Board to build a house and an adjacent 1 m tall brick wall, right across the habitat occupied by the Adders. The construction of the house and brick wall in 2006 has prevented the majority of the snakes from undertaking their annual migration within the study area, resulting in an extirpation {\textgreater} 75{\%} of the Adders.

	abstract = {We document the impact of blood parasite infections caused by Hepatozoon sp. on water python (Liasis fuscus) life history traits such as growth rates, condition, reproductive output and survival. Individual snakes maintained similar among-year parasite loads. Hepatozoon infections affected python growth rate, i.e. snakes suffering from high infection levels exhibited significantly slower growth compared to individuals with low parasite loads. Our results suggest that the parasites also affected the pythons' nutritional status (condition), as snakes with low condition scores suffered from higher parasite infection levels than snakes with high scores. Furthermore, our data suggest that parasitaemia may affect female reproductive output, as reproductive female pythons harboured lower parasite loads compared to non-reproductive adult females. High levels of parasite infections also affected juvenile python survival, as recaptured snakes harboured significantly lower parasite loads compared to non-recaptured yearling pythons. In our study area, water python have very few natural predators and, hence, experience low mortality rates and commonly reach an age of {\textgreater} 15 years. In contrast to results obtained in other studies, parasite loads in larger/ older pythons were lower compared to younger snakes, suggesting that only snakes harbouring lower levels of parasitaemia were able to survive to old age. We suggest that a possible cause for the opposing results regarding parasite prevalence and host age may be due to different levels of extrinsic mortality rates and longevity. Long-lived organisms, such as water pythons, may invest relatively more into crucial self-maintenance functions such as parasite defence, compared to short-lived organisms. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

	abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

We explore patterns of genetic variation within and among these island populations using mitochondrial sequence data (partial ND4 to tRNA(Leu)) in combination with eight polymorphic microsatellite loci (2 to 10 alleles). Genetic data support two phylogeographically distinct groups, Andros Island and the Exuma cays. This result conflicts with current subspecific taxonomy in which three subspecies are described. Analyses of allelic data indicate that most island populations are currently demographically independent. Pairwise Fst values between eight island populations range from 0.18 to 0.63, and 6 of 135 individuals are misassigned in an assignment test. Population-genetic diversity is characterized using standard measures such as number of alleles and heterozygosity (H) in addition to a normalized Shannon-Weaver index of diversity (D). We find genetic diversity in the Andros Island population comparable to that in other non-piscine animals (avg. {\#} of alleles = 5, avg. H = 0.56, avg. D = 0.66) while in the Exuma cays populations these measures are much lower (avg. {\#} of alleles = 2.75-1.625, avg. H = 0.43-0.17, avg. D = 0.45-0.18). These data are used to discuss conservation management strategies, including prioritization and translocation.},

	abstract = {The Caribbean rock iguana, Cyclura, has had an unstable intrageneric taxonomy and an unclear phylogenetic position within the family Iguanidae. We use mtDNA sequence data to address these issues and explore the phylogeographic history of the genus. ND4 to leucine tRNA sequence data were collected from multiple individuals of each of the eight species of Cyclura (including 15 of 16 subspecies) and from four localities of Iguana iguana (representative of this species' broad geographic range). This data set was combined with sequence data from Sites et al. (1996, Mol. Biol. Evol. 13, 1087-1105) and analyzed under maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood optimization criteria. The ND4 region provided good resolution for the majority of nodes, as indicated by high bootstrap support. In agreement with several recent molecular studies, Cyclura is recovered as monophyletic and is not closely related to any other genus, whereas Iguana is strongly supported as the sister taxon to Sauromalus. This result is statistically more likely than other published hypotheses of Iguanid relationships. Cyclura shows a southeast to northwest speciation sequence in the Caribbean, with the most ancient lineage on the Puerto Rican Bank. The amount of interspecific sequence divergence within Cyclura (maximum 11.4{\%}) is very high in comparison to data from other iguanid taxa at this locus, suggesting that this group either has been in the Caribbean for a very long time or has gone through a very rapid rate of evolution at this locus. Using dates from other published studies, we calculate a molecular clock that suggests that Cyclura colonized the Caribbean between 15 and 35 mya. Several questions regarding subspecific taxonomy are raised in the analysis and await further investigation using a more rapidly evolving marker such as nuclear microsatellites.},

To resolve this non-monophyly, we resurrect the taxon Cachryx Cope, 1866, and provide a new diagnosis for the genus. We also find that small body-size and highly spinose tails in the species previously referred to the subgenus Enyaliosaurus, have evolved independently 3 times. Cachryx were recovered as sister to the lineage of iguanines endemic to the Galapagos Islands, and we discuss biogeographic scenarios to explain this relationship as well as those among the primary clades of Ctenosaura in Mesoamerica.},

	abstract = {Hispaniola consists of an agglomeration of 11 island-arc terranes that crop out over the northern two-thirds of the island and one oceanic plateau terrane that crops out over the southern one-third of the island. The island-arc terranes, which range in age from Early Cretaceous to late Eocene, can be classified on the basis of lithologic associations, structure, and metamorphic grade as: (1) fragments of oceanic crust, (2) fragments of the fore arc/accretionary prism of an island arc, (3) fragments of the volcano-plutonic part of an island arc, and (4) a fragment of a back-arc basin. The structure and stratigraphy of the volcano-plutonic and fore-arc/accretionary prism arc terranes of Hispaniola suggest eight main tectonic phases: (1) earliest Cretaceous to pre-Aptian island-arc plutonism, volcanism, and metamorphism mainly in a submarine environment; (2) pre-Aptian uplift and erosion of the island arc in eastern Hispaniola and Puerto Rico possibly associated with arc collision and a subsequent reversal in subduction polarity of the island arc; (3) post-Albian to pre-Campanian renewal of island-arc plutonism, volcanism, and metamorphism mainly in a submarine environment; (4) Campanian deformation and metamorphism possibly associated with a second arc collision and subsequent reversal in subduction polarity of the island arc; (5) post-Campanian to pre-middle Eocene renewal of island-arc plutonism, volcanism, and metamorphism mainly in a submarine environment; (6) middle to early late Eocene collision of the island arc with the southern edge of the North America plate (Bahama carbonate platform); collision uplifted the submerged arc and terminated island-arc volcanism and plutonism; (7) east-west strike-slip faulting subparallel to the strike of partially emerged and eroding arc rocks beginning in the Eocene and lasting to the early Miocene; and (8) early Miocene transpression resulting from oblique collision and suturing of the oceanic plateau terrane with the island-arc terrane and interaction of east-west strike-slip zones with older north-northwest island-arc structures. Many of the terrane boundaries separating island-arc and oceanic plateau terranes were reactivated as oblique-slip faults during early Miocene to Recent convergence between the island-arc and oceanic plateau terranes and form nine morphotectonic provinces consisting of elongate, fault-bounded mountain ranges and intervening clastic sedimentary basins. The structure and stratigraphy of the oceanic plateau terrane suggests four main tectonic phases: (1) Late Cretaceous oceanic plateau growth; (2) Latest Cretaceous deformation and erosion; (3) Paleocene-early Miocene subsidence and strike-slip faulting; and (4) early Miocene to present transpression. The discrepancy between large-scale strike-slip offset along the Cayman Trough ({\~{}}1,110 km) and much smaller offsets of arc rocks in Hispaniola and Central America ({\textless}200 km) is explained by the existence of restraining bends along interplate strike-slip faults in Hispaniola and Central America, which locally transform strike-slip displacement into fault splays, rotation of fault-bounded blocks, vertical uplift, or underthrusting. Based on indirect regional constraints, we infer that both the oceanic and island-arc terranes of Hispaniola originated in the Pacific as part of a single continuous island arc, the ``Great Arc,'' which swept into the Caribbean during Late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic time.},

@article{Manna2011,
	abstract = {Deleterious mutations tend to be recessive. Several theories, notably those of Fisher (based on selection) and Wright (based on metabolism), have been put forward to explain this pattern. Despite a long-lasting debate, the matter remains unresolved. This debate has focused on the average dominance of mutations. However, we also know very little about the distribution of dominance coefficients among mutations, and about its variation across environments. In this article we present a new approach to predicting this distribution. Our approach is based on a phenotypic fitness landscape model. First, we show that under a very broad range of conditions (and environments), the average dominance of mutation of small effects should be approximately one-quarter as long as adaptation of organisms to their environment can be well described by stabilizing selection on an arbitrary set of phenotypic traits. Second, the theory allows predicting the whole distribution of dominance coefficients among mutants. Because it provides quantitative rather than qualitative predictions, this theory can be directly compared to data. We found that its prediction on mean dominance (average dominance close to 0.25) agreed well with the data, based on a meta-analysis of dominance data for mildly deleterious mutations. However, a simple landscape model does not account for the dominance of mutations of large effects and we provide possible extension of the theory for this class of mutations. Because dominance is a central parameter for evolutionary theory, and because these predictions are quantitative, they set the stage for a wide range of applications and further empirical tests.},

	abstract = {Avian chemosignaling remains relatively unexplored, but its potential importance in birds' social behaviors is becoming recognized. Procellariiform seabirds provide particularly appropriate models for investigating these topics as they possess a well-developed olfactory system and unequalled associated capabilities. We present here results from a detailed chemical examination of the uropygial secretions (the main source of avian exogenous chemicals) from 2 petrel species, Antarctic prions and blue petrels. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques and recently developed multivariate tools, we demonstrate that the secretions contain critical socioecological information such as species, gender, and individual identity. Importantly, these chemosignals correlate with some of the birds' olfactory behaviors demonstrated in the field. The molecules found to be associated with social information were essentially large unsaturated compounds, suggesting that these may be precursors of, or correlates to the actual airborne signals. Although the species-specific chemosignal may be involved in interspecific competition at the breeding grounds, the role of the sexually specific chemosignal remains unclear. The existence of individually specific signals (i.e., chemical signatures) in these birds has important implications for processes such as individual recognition and genetically based mate choice already suspected for this group. Our results open promising avenues of research for the study of avian chemical communication},

Of these, C. pallidus (Heller 1903) is endemic to Santa Fe Island; C. subcristatus (Gray 1831) occurs in 11 sites in four islands, whereas C. marthae (Gentile and Snell, 2009) inhabits the northern-western slopes of volcan Wolf (Isabela, island), above 500 m o.s.l. Census surveys indicated that four C. subcristatus populations were extinct, two were seriously impacted by wild dogs and cats. One of the extinct populations was restored and at present all reproduce in situ. Populations were investigated in order to assess adaptability and survivorship of reintroduced juveniles. Mark- recapture methods, simulation models, records of mortality and predation were used. Conolophus subcristatus occurs in 11 sites, in four islands, whereas C. pallidus and C. marthae are strictly endemic to the inhabited localities. These priliminary estimates suggest that C. subcristatus population might be as large as about 11435 individuals, whereas C. pallidus could reach about 5016 individuals. Much less has been estimated for C. marthae, whose population is most likely not exceeding 545 individuals. Population estimates are correlated with densities. Seven C. subcristatus populations and C. marthae show lack of juveniles, which are in turn found in C. pallidus. Generally, with the exception of Plaza Sur and Fernandina where female outnumber males, sex-ratio is biased toward males. Natural mortality seems to be minimal in all species, but C. subcristatus and C. marthae are predated by feral cats and black rats. Although this study is based on a large body of data, results are still to be considered preliminary. In addition, several spotted populations of C. subcristatus have not been evaluated, yet.},

Most of the studied ticks accidentally parasite humans and potentially act as vectors of zoonoses. Lengths of the ITS2 sequences ranged from 956 to 1,207 bp, whereas GC content varied from 62.4 to 66.9{\%}. A matrix of ITS2 divergence was calculated with the ITS2 sequence data obtained showing divergence levels varying from 1.5 to 28.8{\%}. The analysis indicated that this molecular marker can be useful for Amblyomma-specific identification.

	abstract = {Dollo's law, the concept that evolution is not substantively reversible, implies that the degradation of genetic information is sufficiently fast that genes or developmental pathways released from selective pressure will rapidly become nonfunctional. Using empirical data to assess the rate of loss of coding information in genes for proteins with varying degrees of tolerance to mutational change, we show that, in fact, there is a significant probability over evolutionary time scales of 0.5-6 million years for successful reactivation of silenced genes or "lost" developmental programs. Conversely, the reactivation of long ({\textgreater} 10 million years)-unexpressed genes and dormant developmental pathways is not possible unless function is maintained by other selective constraints; the classic example of the resurrection of "hen's teeth" is most likely an experimental artifact, and the experimental reactivation of the Archaeopteryx limb developmental program has been shown to be a misinterpretation. For groups undergoing adaptive radiations, lost features may "flicker" on and off, resulting in a distribution of character states that does not reflect the phylogeny of the group.},

	abstract = {Paternity inference using highly polymorphic codominant markers is becoming common in the study of natural populations. However, multiple males are often found to be genetically compatible with each offspring tested, even when the probability of excluding an unrelated male is high. While various methods exist for evaluating the likelihood of paternity of each nonexcluded male, interpreting these likelihoods has hitherto been difficult, and no method takes account of the incomplete sampling and error-prone genetic data typical of large-scale studies of natural systems. We derive likelihood ratios for paternity inference with codominant markers taking account of typing error, and define a statistic delta for resolving paternity. Using allele frequencies from the study population in question, a simulation program generates criteria for delta that permit assignment of paternity to the most likely male with a known level of statistical confidence. The simulation takes account of the number of candidate males, the proportion of males that are sampled and gaps and errors in genetic data. We explore the potentially confounding effect of relatives and show that the method is robust to their presence under commonly encountered conditions. The method is demonstrated using genetic data from the intensively studied red deer (Cervus elaphus) population on the island of Rum, Scotland. The Windows-based computer program, CERVUS, described in this study is available from the authors. CERVUS can be used to calculate allele frequencies, run simulations and perform parentage analysis using data from all types of codominant markers.},

	abstract = {Aim Niche stability areas (NSAs) are portions of the species range where climate conditions remain suitable through time. They represent the core of species ranges. Their distribution and extent, coupled with dispersal and colonization, shape the realized range of species. In this study, we quantified the roles of survival within NSAs and post-glacial dispersal in determining the current distribution of two groups of alpine butterflies (two taxa in the Erebia tyndarus species complex; three taxa in the Parnassius apollo--P. phoebus species complex). Location Holarctic. Methods NSAs were identified for each taxon by combining current and past potential distributions models, estimated using different modelling techniques and general circulation models. We then (1) assessed the distributional bias towards NSAs by comparing actual occurrence records with randomized occupancies of the current potential range and (2) quantified post-glacial dispersal by examining the distribution of distances from each occurrence record to the nearest NSA. Results In almost all taxa, realized distributions are biased towards NSAs. However, while Erebia's present range is strongly dominated by NSAs, some populations of Parnassius are found very far from NSAs, suggesting more effective colonization of the available geographical space. Main conclusions Our study highlights the relative roles of survival within NSAs and post-glacial dispersal in shaping the ranges of different alpine butterflies during the Holocene. Results suggest that Erebia was unable to disperse far from NSAs, thus experiencing increasing range fragmentation. Parnassius populations, on the other hand, coupled local survival with northward dispersal. As NSAs allowed the long-term survival of the species, acting as sources for recolonization, and tend to preserve most of each species' genetic diversity, identifying NSAs and understanding their importance in determining the current distribution of species represents a pivotal task for the conservation of biological diversity.},

@article{Martin2015,
	abstract = {This article is part of a Special Issue "Chemosignals and Reproduction".Many lizards have diverse glands that produce chemosignals used in intraspecific communication and that can have reproductive consequences. For example, information in chemosignals of male lizards can be used in intrasexual competition to identify and assess the fighting potential or dominance status of rival males either indirectly through territorial scent-marks or during agonistic encounters. Moreover, females of several lizard species "prefer" to establish or spend more time on areas scent-marked by males with compounds signaling a better health or body condition or a higher genetic compatibility, which can have consequences for their mating success and inter-sexual selection processes. We review here recent studies that suggest that the information content of chemosignals of lizards may be reliable because several physiological and endocrine processes would regulate the proportions of chemical compounds available for gland secretions. Because chemosignals are produced by the organism or come from the diet, they should reflect physiological changes, such as different hormonal levels (e.g. testosterone or corticosterone) or different health states (e.g. parasitic infections, immune response), and reflect the quality of the diet of an individual. More importantly, some compounds that may function as chemosignals also have other important functions in the organism (e.g. as antioxidants or regulating the immune system), so there could be trade-offs between allocating these compounds to attending physiological needs or to produce costly sexual "chemical ornaments". All these factors may contribute to maintain chemosignals as condition-dependent sexual signals, which can inform conspecifics on the characteristics and state of the sender and allow making behavioral decisions with reproductive consequences. To understand the evolution of chemical secretions of lizards as sexual signals and their relevance in reproduction, future studies should examine what information the signals are carrying, the physiological processes that can maintain the reliability of the message and how diverse behavioral responses to chemosignals may influence reproductive success.},

@article{Martin2017,
	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s) Our understanding of the role of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC) in recognition is based largely on temperate ant species and honey bees. The stingless bees remain relatively poorly studied, despite being the largest group of eusocial bees, comprising more than 400 species in some 60 genera. The Meliponini and Apini diverged between 80--130 Myr B.P. so the evolutionary trajectories that shaped the chemical communication systems in ants, honeybees and stingless bees may be very different. The aim of this study was to study if a unique species CHC signal existed in Neotropical stingless bees, as has been shown for many temperate species, and what compounds are involved. This was achieved by collecting CHC data from 24 colonies belonging to six species of Melipona from North-Eastern Brazil and comparing the results with previously published CHC studies on Melipona. We found that each of the eleven Melipona species studied so far each produced a unique species CHC signal based around their alkene isomer production. A remarkable number of alkene isomers, up to 25 in M. asilvai, indicated the diversification of alkene positional isomers among the stingless bees. The only other group to have really diversified in alkene isomer production are the primitively eusocial Bumblebees (Bombus spp), which are the sister group of the stingless bees. Furthermore, among the eleven Neotropical Melipona species we could detect no effect of the environment on the proportion of alkane production as has been suggested for some other species.},

	abstract = {Host-parasite systems provide an ideal platform to study evolution at different levels, including codivergence in a historical biogeography context. In this study we aim to describe biogeographic and codivergent patterns and associated processes of the Goodeinae freshwater fish and their digenean parasite (Margotrema spp.) over the last 6.5 Ma (million years), identifying the main factors (host and/or hydrogeomorphology) that influenced the evolution of Margotrema. We obtained a species tree for Margotrema spp. using DNA sequence data from mitochondrial and nuclear molecular markers (COI and ITS1, respectively) and performed molecular dating to discern divergence events within the genus. The dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) model was used to describe the historical biogeography of digeneans and applied to cophylogenetic analyses of Margotrema and their goodeine hosts. Our results showed that the evolutionary history of Margotrema has been shaped in close association with its geographic context, especially with the geological history of central Mexico during the Pleistocene. Host-specificity has been established at three levels of historical association: a) Species-Species, represented by Xenotaenia resolanae-M. resolanae exclusively found in the Cuzalapa River Basin; b) Species-Lineage, represented by Characodon audax-M. bravoae Lineage II, exclusive to the Upper and Middle Mezquital River Basin, and c) Tribe-Lineage, including two instances of historical associations among parasites and hosts at the taxonomical level of tribe, one represented by Ilyodontini-M. bravoae Lineage I (distributed across the Ayuquila and Balsas River Basins), and another comprised of Girardinichthyini/Chapalichthyini-M. bravoae Lineage III, found only in the Lerma River Basin. We show that the evolutionary history of the parasites is, on several occasions, in agreement with the phylogenetic and biogeographic history of their hosts. A series of biogeographic and host-parasite events explain the codivergence patterns observed, in which cospeciation and colonisation via host-switching and vicariant plus dispersal events are appreciated, at different times during the diversification history of both associates, particularly during the Pleistocene.},

	abstract = {Although many animals deposit scent marks, previous studies have focused almost entirely on rodents or on the chemical structure of the signal. Here, we study the quantity and temporal pattern of chemical deposition by the territorial sagebrush lizard Sceloporus graciosus, measuring both femoral pore and fecal deposits. Specifically, we tested whether variation in deposition is a good cue of individual and sexual identity and/or whether it is more closely associated with body size and reproductive state, indicators of physiological condition. The results support the latter hypothesis. We found that although the amount of fluid deposited on a single perch (rarely quantified in mammals) carries little information on individual or sexual identity, it reflects the physiological condition and reproductive state of individual lizards and is replenished on a roughly weekly cycle, potentially providing additional information on the producer's activity level. The amount of deposition may thus provide important information to chemical receivers making mate choice and territorial defense decisions. The results further suggest that seasonal increases in gland production allow lizards to mark more sites rather than to influence the quality of the signal on a single perch. {\textcopyright} Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2006.},

However, due to the absence of morphological descriptions of the nymphal stage of most Brazilian Amblyomma species, plus the lack of an identification key, little or nothing is known about the life history of Amblyomma spp. nymphs in the country. In the present study, morphological description of the nymphal stage, illustrating important external characters through scanning electron microscopy, is provided for nymphs of 15 Amblyomma species that occur in Brazil, for which the nymphal stage had never been described: A. aureolatum, A. auricularium, A. calcaratum, A. coelebs, A. fuscum, A. humerale, A. incisum, A. latepunctatum, A. naponense, A. nodosum, A. ovale, A. pacae, A. pseudoconcolor, A. scalpturatum, A. varium. In addition, the nymphal stage of 12 Amblyomma species, which had been previously described, are redescribed: A. brasiliense, A. cajennense, A. dissimile, A. dubitatum, A. longirostre, A. oblongoguttatum, A. parkeri, A. parvum, A. romitii, A. rotundatum, A. tigrinum, A. triste. The descriptions and redescriptions totalized 27 species. Only 2 species (A. geayi, A. goeldii) out of the 29 Amblyomma species established in Brazil are not included in the present study.

	abstract = {A model is presented in which a large population in mutation/drift equilibrium undergoes a severe restriction in size and subsequently remains at the small size. The rate of loss of genetic variability has been studied. Allelic loss occurs more rapidly than loss of genic heterozygosity. Rare alleles are lost especially rapidly. The result is a transient deficiency in the total number of alleles observed in samples taken from the reduced population when compared with the number expected in a sample from a steady-state population having the same observed heterozygosity. Alternatively, the population can be considered to posses excess gene diversity if the number of alleles is used as the statistical estimator of mutation rate. The deficit in allele number arises principally from a lack of those alleles that are expected to appear only once or twice in the sample. The magnitude of the allelic deficiency is less, however, than the excess that an earlier study predicted to follow a rapid population expansion. This suggests that populations that have undergone a single bottleneck event, followed by rapid population growth, should have an apparent excess number of alleles, given the observed level of genic heterozygosity and provided that the bottleneck has not occurred very recently. Conversely, such populations will be deficient for observed heterozygosity if allele number is used as the sufficient statistic for the estimation of 4Nev . Populations that have undergone very recent restrictions in size should show the opposite tendencies.},

Although all reptile orders are examined, the vast majority of the literature has dealt only with squamates, primarily snakes and lizards. The literature is surprisingly large, but most studies have explored relatively few behaviors. The evolution of chemical signaling in reptiles is discussed along with behaviors governed by pheromones including conspecific trailing, male-male agonistic interactions, sex recognition and sex pheromones, and reptilian predator recognition. Nonreptilian prey recognition by chemical cues was not reviewed. The recent literature has focused on two model systems where extensive chemical ecology studies have been conducted: the reproductive ecology of garter snakes and the behavioral ecology of Iberian lacertid lizards. In these two systems, enough is known about the chemical constituents that mediate behaviors to explore the evolution of chemical signaling mechanisms that affect life history patterns. In addition, these models illuminate natural and sexual selection processes which have lead to complex chemical signals whose different components and concentrations provide essential information about individuals to conspecifics. Reptiles provide excellent candidates for further studies in this regard not only in squamates, but also in the orders where little experimental work has been conducted to date.},

	abstract = {The dispersal and subsequent gene flow within parasite species is the result of a complex interaction between parasite life history, host life history and abiotic environmental factors. To gain more insights into the drivers responsible for parasite dispersal, COI mtDNA genetic data derived from six southern African generalist parasite species, including fleas, mites and ticks were compared with four specialist species from the same geographic region. Generalist tick species represented by Amblyomma hebraeum, Hyalomma truncatum and H. rufipes all occur temporarily on highly mobile ungulate hosts and showed high levels of haplotypic genetic diversity and high levels of dispersal with an average intraspecific global Fst (population differentiation index) value of 0.27 ($\pm$0.13). Generalist parasites, such as fleas, Listropsylla agrippinae and Chiastopsylla rossi, and one mite species, Laelaps muricola, that are all semi-permanent on the host and restricted to less mobile hosts species, showed a similar high level of genetic diversity, but an intermediate average Fst value of 0.67 ($\pm$0.11). Highly specialised semi-permanent parasites, such as the mite L. giganteus and the permanent lice Polyplax praomydis, Hoplopleura patersoni and P. arvicanthis recorded the lowest level of genetic diversity and a low level of gene flow among geographic sampling localities with an average Fst value of 0.95 ($\pm$0.05). This study provides strong support for the Specialist Generalist Variation Hypothesis (SGVH) and highlights the role that host dispersal and host specialisation by parasites play in the dispersal and evolution of ectoparasites. },

	abstract = {At least 22 concepts of species are in use today and many of these are notably incompatible in their accounts of biological diversity. Much of the traditional turmoil embodied in the species problem ultimately derives from the packaging of inappropriate criteria for species into a single concept. This results from a traditional conflation of function of concepts with their applications, definitions with concepts, taxonomic categories with groups, and the ontological status of real species with teleological approaches to recover them. Analogous to classifications of supraspecific taxa, our forging inappropriate and ambiguous information relating to theoretical and operational discussions of species ultimately results in a trade-off between convenience, accuracy, precision, and the successful recovery of natural biological diversity. Hence, none of these expectations or intentions of species or classifications is attainable through composite, and possibly discordant, concepts of biological diversity or its descent. Reviowing and evaluating the concepts of species for their theoretical and operational qualities illustrates that a monistic, primary conept of species, applicable to the various entiies believed to be species, is essential. this evaluation reveals only one theoretical concept as appropriate for species, the Evolutionary Species Concept. This conceptualiztion functions as a primary concept and is essential in structuring our ideas and perceptions of real species in the natural world. The remaining concepts are secondary, forming a hierarchy of definitional guidelines subordinate to the primary concept, and are essential to the study of species in practice.

This may explain why the extent of polymorphism in natural populations does not vary as much as one would expect from a consideration of the equilibrium between mutation and random fixation in populations of different sizes. For a selectively maintained polymorphism at a linked locus, this process will only be important in the long run if it leads to complete fixation. If the selective coefficients at the linked locus are small compared to those at the substituted locus, it is shown that the probability of complete fixation at the linked locus is approximately exp Nc), where c is the recombinant fraction and N the population size. It follows that in a large population a selective substitution can occur in a cistron without eliminating a selectively maintained polymorphism in the same cistron.},

	abstract = {We describe a new method of estimating the selfing rate (S) in a mixed mating population based on a population structure approach that accounts for possible intergenerational correlation in selfing rate, giving rise to an estimate of the upper limit for heritability of selfing rate (h2). A correlation between generations in selfing rate is shown to affect one- and two-locus probabilities of identity by descent. Conventional estimates of selfing rate based on a population structure approach are positively biased by intergenerational correlation in selfing. Multilocus genotypes of individuals are used to give maximum-likelihood estimates of S and h2 in the presence of scoring artifacts. Our multilocus estimation of selfing rate and its heritability (MESH) method was tested with simulated data for a range of conditions. Selfing rate estimates from MESH have low bias and root mean squared error, whereas estimates of the heritability of selfing rate have more uncertainty. Increasing the number of individuals in a sample helps to reduce bias and root mean squared error more than increasing the number of loci of sampled individuals. Improved estimates of selfing rate, as well as estimates of its heritability, can be obtained with this method, although a large number of loci and individuals are needed to achieve best results.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Recent observations on the western Antarctic Peninsula have suggested that changing climatic conditions may be increasing pressure on breeding seabirds due to higher exploitation rates by the tick Ixodes uriae. Using data from 8 microsatellite markers and ticks from 6 Pygoscelis spp. colonies, we employed a population genetics approach to specifically test the hypothesis that I. uriae is expanding south-westward along the peninsula from the Subantarctic region. Contrary to expectations, tick genetic diversity was high within all colonies, and no remaining signal of colonisation events was evident. Although significant geographic genetic structure occurred among ticks from different colonies, these ectoparasites tended to belong to 2 major genetic groups, one found principally in south-western locations (Palmer Station area) and the other in more north-eastern areas (South Shetland Islands). More central colonies showed a mixture of ticks from each genetic group, suggesting that this area represents a hybridisation zone of ticks from 2 distinct origins. A subsequent clustering analysis, including ticks from 2 Subantarctic locations, did not reveal the source population for the northern peninsula group. Overall, our data refute the hypothesis of a recent south-westward expansion of I. uriae along the peninsula and suggest that this tick has been present at more southern latitudes for an extended period of time. Further studies on the distribution and genetic characteristics of this ectoparasite around Antarctica are now required to better understand the colonisation process and predict how changing environmental conditions may affect its presence and diversity in seabird colonies.},

	abstract = {Although much insight is to be gained through the comparison of the population genetic structures of parasites and hosts, there are, at present, few studies that take advantage of the information on vertebrate life histories available through the consideration of their parasites. Here, we examined the genetic structure of a colonial seabird, the black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) using seven polymorphic microsatellite markers to make inferences about population functioning and intercolony dispersal. We sampled kittiwakes from 22 colonies across the species' range and, at the same time, collected individuals of one of its common ectoparasites, the tick Ixodes uriae. Parasites were genotyped at eight microsatellite markers and the population genetic structure of host and parasite were compared. Kittiwake populations are only genetically structured at large spatial scales and show weak patterns of isolation by distance. This may be due to long-distance dispersal events that erase local patterns of population subdivision. However, important additional information is gained by comparing results with those of the parasite. In particular, tick populations are strongly structured at regional scales and show a stepping-stone pattern of gene flow. Due to the parasite's life history, its population structure is directly linked to the frequency and spatial extent of within-breeding season movements of kittiwakes. The comparison of host and parasite gene flow therefore helps us to disentangle the intercolony movements of birds from that of true dispersal events (movement followed by reproduction). In addition, such data can provide essential elements for predicting the outcome of local co-evolutionary interactions.},

	abstract = {Despite the fact that parasite dispersal is likely to be one of the most important processes influencing the dynamics and coevolution of host-parasite interactions, little information is available on the factors that affect it. In most cases, opportunities for parasite dispersal should be closely linked to host biology. Here we use microsatellite genetic markers to compare the population structure and dispersal of two host races of the seabird tick Ixodes uriae at the scale of the North Atlantic. Interestingly, tick populations showed high within-population genetic variation and relatively low population differentiation. However, gene flow at different spatial scales seemed to depend on the host species exploited. The black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) had structured tick populations showing patterns of isolation by distance, whereas tick populations of the Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) were only weakly structured at the largest scale considered. Host-dependent rates of tick dispersal between colonies will alter infestation probabilities and local dynamics and may thus modify the adaptation potential of ticks to local hosts. Moreover, as I. uriae is a vector of the Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in both hemispheres, the large-scale movements of birds and the subsequent dispersal of ticks will have important consequences for the dynamics and coevolutionary interactions of this microparasite with its different vertebrate and invertebrate hosts.},

	abstract = {Stature is a classical and highly heritable complex trait, with 80{\%}-90{\%} of variation explained by genetic factors. In recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified many common additive variants influencing human height; however, little attention has been given to the potential role of recessive genetic effects. Here, we investigated genome-wide recessive effects by an analysis of inbreeding depression on adult height in over 35,000 people from 21 different population samples. We found a highly significant inverse association between height and genome-wide homozygosity, equivalent to a height reduction of up to 3 cm in the offspring of first cousins compared with the offspring of unrelated individuals, an effect which remained after controlling for the effects of socio-economic status, an important confounder ($\chi$(2) = 83.89, df = 1; p = 5.2 × 10(-20)). There was, however, a high degree of heterogeneity among populations: whereas the direction of the effect was consistent across most population samples, the effect size differed significantly among populations. It is likely that this reflects true biological heterogeneity: whether or not an effect can be observed will depend on both the variance in homozygosity in the population and the chance inheritance of individual recessive genotypes. These results predict that multiple, rare, recessive variants influence human height. Although this exploratory work focuses on height alone, the methodology developed is generally applicable to heritable quantitative traits (QT), paving the way for an investigation into inbreeding effects, and therefore genetic architecture, on a range of QT of biomedical importance.},

However, the consequences of inbreeding on long-term survival and reproductive success (Darwinian fitness) are uncertain for vertebrates in the wild. Here, we report direct experimental evidence for vertebrates that competition increases the harmful effects of inbreeding on offspring survival and reproduction. We compared the fitness of inbred (from full-sib matings) and outbred wild house mice (Mus domesticus) in large, seminatural enclosures. Inbred males sired only one-fifth as many surviving offspring as outbred males because of their poor competitive ability and survivorship. In laboratory conditions, inbreeding had relatively minor effects on male reproductive success and no effect on survivorship. Seminatural conditions did not increase inbreeding depression for females, probably because females were not competing for any critical resources. The overall reduction in fitness from inbreeding was 57{\%}, which is 4.5 times as great as previous estimates from the laboratory. These results have important implications for medicine, conservation, evolutionary biology, and functional genomics.},

	abstract = {The domestic cat has been introduced on most islands worldwide, where it has established feral populations and is currently known to be one of the worst invasive mammalian predators. Predation is the strongest deleterious effect of cats on wildlife, inducing a direct negative impact on population size and dynamics, breeding success and changes in species assemblages. Direct predation is not the only damaging impact on native wildlife, since cats can be responsible for other poorly-documented underlying ecological impacts, like competition, hybridization, disease transmission, ecological process alteration, and behavioral change. Here, we pinpoint relevant examples of these ecological impacts, by searching for accurate data from published literature. We used electronic databases covering most of the world islands where the effects of cats were documented. Knowledge of these impacts can be of great importance to preserve insular ecosystem functions and persistence of endangered native species. We emphasize that direct predation processes should not be the only factor considered in the management of invasive cats on islands. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {We used photo-identification to produce estimates of population size and structure of whale sharks Rhincodon typus at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia. We analysed photographs of whale sharks taken from 1992 to 2004. A combination of spot and stripe patterns behind the last gill slit and forward of the dorsal fin (lateral view), and distinctive scars and marks on the body and fins were useful for identifying individual sharks. These patterns appeared to be unique to individuals and distinctive markings could be recognized on some sharks for more than a decade. From 581 photographs, 159 individuals were identified. Of these, 74{\%} were male, 16{\%} were female and 10{\%} were of indeterminate gender. Photographed sharks ranged in estimated size from 3 to 10 m total length (TL). The size distribution of sharks was bimodal with a large peak at 8 m and a smaller peak at 6 m TL. Sixty individuals were resighted during the study. Of these, 46 were resighted at different times during the same year (sometimes on multiple occasions) up to 4 mo after they were initially photographed, and 33 were resighted (4 on {\textgreater} 2 occasions) in different years. The interval between inter-annual resightings was typically 1 to 3 yr; however, 2 sharks were resighted after a period of 12 yr. We estimated the super population of whale sharks that visit Ningaloo Reef to consist of approximately 300 to 500 individuals (95{\%} confidence interval) based on closed population models, or 320 to 440 based on Jolly-Seber open-population models. Our study shows that photo-identification offers a practical, non-invasive and non-destructive means to obtain data on the population size and demography of whale sharks.},

This paper reports the complete mitochondrial genome sequences of three Crocodylus species, Crocodylus moreletii, Crocodylus johnstoni and Crocodylus palustris, and compares the newly obtained mitochondrial DNA sequences with other crocodilians, available in the public databases. The mitochondrial genomes of C. moreletii, C. johnstoni and C. palustris are 16,827. bp, 16,851. bp and 16,852. bp in length, respectively. These mitochondrial genomes consist of 13 protein coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes and a non-coding region. The mitochondrial genomes of all the Crocodylus species, studied herein show identical characteristics in terms of nucleotide composition and codon usage, suggestive of the existence of analogous evolutionary patterns within the genus, Crocodylus. The synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates for all the protein coding genes of Crocodylus were observed in between 0.001 and 0.275 which reveal the prevalence of purifying selection in these genes. The phylogenetic analyses based on complete mitochondrial DNA data substantiate the previously established crocodilian phylogeny. This study provides a better understanding of the crocodilian mitochondrial genome and the data described herein will prove useful for future studies concerning crocodilian mitochondrial genome evolution. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The genus Crocodylus consists of 11 species including the largest living reptile, Crocodylus porosus. The current understanding of the intrageneric relationships between the members of the genus Crocodylus is sparse. Even though members of this genus have been included in many phylogenetic analyses, different molecular approaches have resulted in incongruent trees leaving the phylogenetic relationships among the members of Crocodylus unresolved inclusive of the placement of C. porosus. In this study, the complete mitochondrial genome sequences along with the partial mitochondrial gene sequences and a nuclear gene, C-mos were utilized to infer the intrageneric relationships among Crocodylus species with a special emphasis on the phylogenetic position of C. porosus. Four different phylogenetic methods, Neighbour Joining, Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference, were utilized to reconstruct the crocodilian phylogeny. The uncorrected pairwise distances computed in the study, show close proximity of C. porosus to C. siamensis and the tree topologies thus obtained, also consistently substantiated this relationship with a high statistical support. In addition, the relationship between C. acutus and C. intermedius was retained in all the analyses. The results of the current phylogenetic study support the well established intergeneric crocodilian phylogenetic relationships. Thus, this study proposes the sister relationship between C. porosus and C. siamensis and also suggests the close relationship of C. acutus to C. intermedius within the genus Crocodylus. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Current and past parasite transmission may depend on the overlap of host distributions, potentially affecting parasite specificity and co-evolutionary processes. Nonetheless, parasite diversification may take place in sympatry when parasites are transmitted by vectors with low mobility. Here, we test the co-speciation hypothesis between lizard final hosts of the Family Lacertidae, and blood parasites of the genus Schellackia, which are potentially transmitted by haematophagous mites. The effects of current distributional overlap of host species on parasite specificity are also investigated. We sampled 27 localities on the Iberian Peninsula and three in northern Africa, and collected blood samples from 981 individual lizards of seven genera and 18 species. The overall prevalence of infection by parasites of the genus Schellackia was ∼35{\%}. We detected 16 Schellackia haplotypes of the 18S rRNA gene, revealing that the genus Schellackia is more diverse than previously thought. Phylogenetic analyses showed that Schellackia haplotypes grouped into two main monophyletic clades, the first including those detected in host species endemic to the Mediterranean region and the second those detected in host genera Acanthodactylus, Zootoca and Takydromus. All but one of the Schellackia haplotypes exhibited a high degree of host specificity at the generic level and 78.5{\%} of them exclusively infected single host species. Some host species within the genera Podarcis (six species) and Iberolacerta (two species) were infected by three non-specific haplotypes of Schellackia, suggesting that host switching might have positively influenced past diversification of the genus. However, the results supported the idea that current host switching is rare because there existed a significant positive correlation between the number of exclusive parasite haplotypes and the number of host species with current sympatric distribution. This result, together with significant support for host--parasite molecular co-speciation, suggests that parasites of the genus Schellackia co-evolved with their lizard hosts.},

	abstract = {The genetic population structure of many species is characterised by a pattern of isolation by distance (IBD): due to limited dispersal, individuals that are geographically close tend to be genetically more similar than individuals that are far apart. Despite the ubiquity of IBD in nature, many commonly used statistical tests are based on a null model that is completely non-spatial, the Island model. Here, I argue that patterns of spatial autocorrelation deriving from IBD present a problem for such tests as it can severely bias their outcome. I use simulated data to illustrate this problem for two widely used types of tests: tests of hierarchical population structure and the detection of loci under selection. My results show that for both types of tests the presence of IBD can indeed lead to a large number of false positives. I therefore argue that all analyses in a study should take the spatial dependence in the data into account, unless it can be shown that there is no spatial autocorrelation in the allele frequency distribution that is under investigation. Thus, it is urgent to develop additional statistical approaches that are based on a spatially explicit null model instead of the non-spatial Island model.},

	abstract = {The estimation of migration rates using molecular markers is an important aspect of many population genetic studies. Several different methods are available for estimating migration, but most of these make multiple limiting assumptions. One method that is relatively free from assumptions is bayesass, which uses assignment methods in a Bayesian framework. However, when tested using simulated data, this method was found to have problems with the convergence of the Markov chain Monte Carlo. Here, I perform a literature study to test whether these convergence problems are also present when bayesass is used to estimate migration rates from empirical data. A review of 100 studies that have used bayesass shows that this is indeed the case. The estimated proportions of nonmigrants were mostly either close to 2/3 or 1, indicating that the MCMC tends to get trapped near the bounds of the prior distribution. In addition, I found that the quality of the inference was negatively affected by the number of sampled populations, but increased with increasing numbers of sampled individuals and with the strength of the population structure as measured by FST . Based on these results, I give several recommendations that should help to reduce problems when using bayesass with empirical data. Most importantly, I argue that researchers should be more realistic about inferences of migration rates and that bayesass will give optimal results only when the experiment has been especially designed around its use.},

	abstract = {Determining the genetic structure of populations is becoming an increasingly important aspect of genetic studies. One of the most frequently used methods is the calculation of F-statistics using an Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA). However, this has the drawback that the population hierarchy has to be known a priori. Therefore, the population structure is often based on the results of a clustering analysis. Here I show how these two steps, clustering and calculation of F-statistics, can be combined in a single analysis. I do this by showing how the AMOVA framework is theoretically related to the widely used method of K-means clustering and can be used for the clustering of populations into groups. Simulations were used to show that the method performed very well both under random mating and under nonrandom mating. However, when the migration rates were high, the results were better under random mating than under predominant selfing or clonal reproduction. Two summary statistics were tested for estimating the number of clusters. Overall, pseudo-F showed the better performance, but BIC is better for detecting whether any significant structure is present. The results show that the AMOVA-based K-means clustering is useful for clustering population genetic data. Programs to perform the clustering can be downloaded from www.patrickmeirmans.com/software.},

	abstract = {The role of the mitochondria in disease, general health and aging has drawn much attention over the years. Several attempts have been made to describe how the numbers of mitochondria correlate with age, although with inconclusive results. In this study, the relative quantity of mitochondrial DNA compared to nuclear DNA, i.e. the mitochondrial DNA copy number, was measured by PCR technology and used as a proxy for the content of mitochondria copies. In 1,067 Danish twins and singletons (18-93 years of age), with the majority being elderly individuals, the estimated mean mitochondrial DNA copy number in peripheral blood cells was similar for those 18-48 years of age [mean relative mtDNA content: 61.0; 95 {\%} CI (52.1; 69.9)], but declined by -0.54 mtDNA 95 {\%} CI (-0.63; -0.45) every year for those older than approximately 50 years of age. However, the longitudinal, yearly decline within an individual was more than twice as steep as observed in the cross-sectional analysis [decline of mtDNA content: -1.27; 95 {\%} CI (-1.71; -0.82)]. Subjects with low mitochondrial DNA copy number had poorer outcomes in terms of cognitive performance, physical strength, self-rated health, and higher all-cause mortality than subjects with high mitochondrial DNA copy number, also when age was controlled for. The copy number mortality association can contribute to the smaller decline in a cross-sectional sample of the population compared to the individual, longitudinal decline. This study suggests that high mitochondrial DNA copy number in blood is associated with better health and survival among elderly.},

	abstract = {The mating system of a plant is the prime determinant of its population genetic structure. However, mating system effects may be modified by postzygotic mechanisms like inbreeding depression. Furthermore, historical as well as contemporary ecological factors and population characteristics, like the location within the species range can contribute to genetic variability. Using microsatellite markers we assessed the population genetic structure of the wind-pollinated Juncus atratus in 16 populations from peripheral and nearly central areas of the distribution range and studied the mating system of the species. In three peripheral populations, outcrossing rates at seeds stage were low (mean t(m) = 5.6{\%}), suggesting a highly autogamous mating system. Despite this fact, on adult stage both individual heterozygosity (mean H(O) = 0.48) and gene diversity (mean H(E) = 0.58) were high even in small populations. Inbreeding coefficients were consistently low among all populations (mean F(IS) = 0.15). Within the three peripheral populations indirect estimates of lifetime inbreeding depression were surprisingly high (delta(eq) = 0.96) and inbreeding depression could be shown to act mostly on early seedling establishment. Similar conditions of autogamy combined with high inbreeding depression are typical for plants with a large lifetime genomic mutation rate that cannot avoid selfing by geitonogamy. However, the results presented here are unexpected for small-statured, herbaceous plants. Substantial genetic differentiation among all populations was found (mean F(ST) = 0.24). An isolation-by-distance pattern was apparent on large scale but not on local scale suggesting that the overall pattern was largely influenced by historical factors, e.g. colonization, whereas locally genetic drift was of greater importance than gene flow. Peripheral populations exhibited lower genetic diversity and higher inbreeding coefficients when compared with subcentral populations.},

	abstract = {Isolation and restricted gene flow can lead to genetic deterioration in populations. Populations of many species are increasingly becoming fragmented due to human impacts and active management is required to prevent further extinctions. Islands provide an ideal location to protect species from many mainland threatening processes such as habitat loss and fragmentation, disease and competition/predation from introduced species. However their isolation and small population size renders them prone to loss of genetic diversity and to inbreeding. This study examined two endemic and one introduced population of tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) on three islands in the Houtman Abrolhos Archipelago, Western Australia: East Wallabi (EWI), West Wallabi (WWI) and North Islands (NI). Nine autosomal and four Y-linked microsatellite loci, and sequence data from the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region were used to examine the impact of long-term isolation (EWI and WWI) and small founder size (NI) on genetic diversity and inbreeding. This study found all three populations had low genetic diversity, high levels of effective inbreeding and increased frequency of morphological abnormalities. Isolation has also led to significant inter-population genetic differentiation. These results highlight the importance of incorporating genetic management strategies when utilising islands as refuges for declining mainland populations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFCs) are often used to link individual genetic variation to differences in fitness. However, most studies examining HFCs find weak or no correlations. Here, we derive broad theoretical predictions about how many loci are needed to adequately measure genomic heterozygosity assuming different levels of identity disequilibrium (ID), a proxy for inbreeding. We then evaluate the expected ability to detect HFCs using an empirical data set of 200 microsatellites and 412 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in two populations of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), with different demographic histories. In both populations, heterozygosity was significantly correlated across marker types, although the strength of the correlation was weaker in a native population compared with one founded via translocation and later supplemented with additional individuals. Despite being bi-allelic, SNPs had similar correlations to genome-wide heterozygosity as microsatellites in both populations. For both marker types, this association became stronger and less variable as more markers were considered. Both populations had significant levels of ID; however, estimates were an order of magnitude lower in the native population. As with heterozygosity, SNPs performed similarly to microsatellites, and precision and accuracy of the estimates of ID increased as more loci were considered. Although dependent on the demographic history of the population considered, these results illustrate that genome-wide heterozygosity, and therefore HFCs, are best measured by a large number of markers, a feat now more realistically accomplished with SNPs than microsatellites.},

	abstract = {Island populations are an interesting dichotomy in conservation biology. On the one hand, they can be a refuge for species where mainland populations have been decimated by loss of habitat and predation by exotic predators. On the other hand, island populations usually have reduced genetic diversity and are more susceptible to extinction through genetic and demographic processes. Genetic variation and morphological characters were measured for island and mainland populations of Parantechinus apicalis, small dasyurid marsupials, restricted to southwest Australia. Genetic variation at seven microsatellite loci revealed low levels of heterozygosity (H-e = 0.20 - 0.44) and high levels of inbreeding (F-e = 0.40 - 0.72) in island populations compared with the mainland population (H-e = 0.73). A nested clade analysis revealed that allopatric fragmentation was probably responsible for the association between geographical location and control region haplotypes, which is consistent with the isolation of populations on islands and indicative of two main populations of P apicalis representing separate conservation units for management. While these results are typical of many island populations, they have important implications in terms of the conservation of threatened species in Australia and around the world, where island populations are a common source of founders for captive breeding and translocation to mainland sites.},

	abstract = {Kingman's coalescent process opens the door for estimation of population genetics model parameters from molecular sequences. One paramount parameter of interest is the effective population size. Temporal variation of this quantity characterizes the demographic history of a population. Because researchers are rarely able to choose a priori a deterministic model describing effective population size dynamics for data at hand, nonparametric curve-fitting methods based on multiple change-point (MCP) models have been developed. We propose an alternative to change-point modeling that exploits Gaussian Markov random fields to achieve temporal smoothing of the effective population size in a Bayesian framework. The main advantage of our approach is that, in contrast to MCP models, the explicit temporal smoothing does not require strong prior decisions. To approximate the posterior distribution of the population dynamics, we use efficient, fast mixing Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms designed for highly structured Gaussian models. In a simulation study, we demonstrate that the proposed temporal smoothing method, named Bayesian skyride, successfully recovers "true" population size trajectories in all simulation scenarios and competes well with the MCP approaches without evoking strong prior assumptions. We apply our Bayesian skyride method to 2 real data sets. We analyze sequences of hepatitis C virus contemporaneously sampled in Egypt, reproducing all key known aspects of the viral population dynamics. Next, we estimate the demographic histories of human influenza A hemagglutinin sequences, serially sampled throughout 3 flu seasons.},

@article{Minin2003,
	abstract = {Phylogenetic estimation has largely come to rely on explicitly model-based methods. This approach requires that a model be chosen and that that choice be justified. To date, justification has largely been accomplished through use of likelihood-ratio tests (LRTs) to assess the relative fit of a nested series of reversible models. While this approach certainly represents an important advance over arbitrary model selection, the best fit of a series of models may not always provide the most reliable phylogenetic estimates for finite real data sets, where all available models are surely incorrect. Here, we develop a novel approach to model selection, which is based on the Bayesian information criterion, but incorporates relative branch-length error as a performance measure in a decision theory (DT) framework. This DT method includes a penalty for overfitting, is applicable prior to running extensive analyses, and simultaneously compares all models being considered and thus does not rely on a series of pairwise comparisons of models to traverse model space. We evaluate this method by examining four real data sets and by using those data sets to define simulation conditions. In the real data sets, the DT method selects the same or simpler models than conventional LRTs. In order to lend generality to the simulations, codon-based models (with parameters estimated from the real data sets) were used to generate simulated data sets, which are therefore more complex than any of the models we evaluate. On average, the DT method selects models that are simpler than those chosen by conventional LRTs. Nevertheless, these simpler models provide estimates of branch lengths that are more accurate both in terms of relative error and absolute error than those derived using the more complex (yet still wrong) models chosen by conventional LRTs. This method is available in a program called DT-ModSel.},

From May to June 2009, 1069 Amblyomma cajennense ticks were removed from 40 capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) in a rural locality of Monteria. Furthermore, 458 Amblyomma sp. larvae and 20 Amblyomma sp. nymphs were collected in a rural locality of Los Cordobas (Cordoba) by drag sampling on vegetation (n= 1547). Ticks were grouped into pools and tested for rickettsial infection by real-time PCR targeting the rickettsial gene gltA. Subsequently, PCR targeting for gltA, ompA, ompB, and 16S rRNA, sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses were undertaken. Rickettsial DNA was detected in 10 (4.6{\%}) out of 214 pools of ticks by RT-PCR. Five (33{\%}) of free-living Amblyomma sp. larval pools were positive, as well as 5 (2.6{\%}) pools from A. cajennense. Only the gltA gene was amplified from 5 pools of free-living larvae. The nucleotide sequences were 100{\%} identical to R. bellii by BLAST. Only one pool from A. cajennense was positive for gltA, ompA, ompB, and 16S rRNA. The partial nucleotide sequences of these genes were 100{\%} identical to nucleotide sequences of the same genes of a new proposed species Candidatus Rickettsia sp. strain Colombianensi. This is the first report of R. bellii in ticks in Colombia and the second report of detection of Candidatus Rickettsia sp. strain Colombianensi.

Rickettsial DNA was found in 28 pools of ticks (16 A. dissimile pools and 12 free-living larvae pools) out of 113 (24.7{\%}) using real-time PCR. The same 28 pools were also positive using conventional PCR assays aimed to amplify gltA, ompA, and ompB. For each gene analyzed, PCR products obtained from 4/28 pools (two pools of A. dissimile, one pool of Amblyomma sp. larvae and one pool of Rh. microplus larvae) were randomly chosen and sequenced twice. Nucleotide sequences generated were identical to each other for each of the rickettsial genes gltA, ompA, and ompB, and showed 99.4, 95.6, and 96.4{\%} identity with those of Rickettsia tamurae. They were deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers JF905456, JF905458, and JF905457, respectively. In conclusion, we present the first molecular evidence of a novel Rickettsia (Rickettsia sp. strain Colombianensi) infecting A. dissimile ticks collected from iguanas, and also Rh. microplus and unspeciated Amblyomma larvae from vegetation in Colombia.},

	abstract = {A hierarchial population genetic study was conducted on 703 individual Amblyomma americanum from nine populations in Georgia, U.S.A. Populations were sampled from the Coastal Plain, midland Piedmont region, and the upper Piedmont region. Twenty-nine distinct haplotypes were found. A minimum spanning tree was constructed that indicated these haplotypes comprised two lineages, the root of which was distinctly star-like. The majority of the variation found was among ticks within each population, indicating high amounts of gene flow and little genetic differentiation between the three regions. An overall F(ST) value of 0.006 supported the lack of genetic structuring between collection sites in Georgia. Mantel regression analysis revealed no isolation by distance. Signatures of population expansion were detected in the shapes of the mismatch distribution and tests of neutrality. The absence of genetic differentiation combined with the rejection of the null model of isolation by distance may indicate recent range expansion in Georgia or insufficient time to reach an equilibrium where genetic drift may have affected allele frequencies. Alternatively, the high degree of panmixia found within A. americanum in Georgia may be due to bird-mediated dispersal of ticks increasing the genetic similarity between geographically separated populations.},

	abstract = {We developed a set of universal PCR primers (MiFish-U/E) for metabarcoding environmental DNA (eDNA) from fishes. Primers were designed using aligned whole mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequences from 880 species, supplemented by partial mitogenome sequences from 160 elasmobranchs (sharks and rays). The primers target a hypervariable region of the 12S rRNA gene (163-185 bp), which contains sufficient information to identify fishes to taxonomic family, genus and species except for some closely related congeners. To test versatility of the primers across a diverse range of fishes, we sampled eDNA from four tanks in the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium with known species compositions, prepared dual-indexed libraries and performed paired-end sequencing of the region using high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies. Out of the 180 marine fish species contained in the four tanks with reference sequences in a custom database, we detected 168 species (93.3{\%}) distributed across 59 families and 123 genera. These fishes are not only taxonomically diverse, ranging from sharks and rays to higher teleosts, but are also greatly varied in their ecology, including both pelagic and benthic species living in shallow coastal to deep waters. We also sampled natural seawaters around coral reefs near the aquarium and detected 93 fish species using this approach. Of the 93 species, 64 were not detected in the four aquarium tanks, rendering the total number of species detected to 232 (from 70 families and 152 genera). The metabarcoding approach presented here is non-invasive, more efficient, more cost-effective and more sensitive than the traditional survey methods. It has the potential to serve as an alternative (or complementary) tool for biodiversity monitoring that revolutionizes natural resource management and ecological studies of fish communities on larger spatial and temporal scales.},

	abstract = {Translocation is a widely used tool in wildlife management, but populations established as a result of translocations may be subject to a range of genetic problems, including loss of genetic diversity and founder effects. The genetic impact of single translocation events can be difficult to assess because of complex management histories in translocated or source populations. Here we use molecular markers to assess the genetic impact of three well-documented translocation events, each occurring between 42 and 53 years ago and each originating from a native, extant source population that we also included in our study. Comparing translocated populations to their sources, we found genetic evidence of a recent bottleneck in all three translocated populations, including one which is now a very large, productive population. Based on our results, we recommend caution in (1) using short term census data to assess the long term success of a translocation and (2) conducting serial translocations (i.e., using translocated populations as the source for other translocations), which could exacerbate a genetic bottleneck. We also used the data on translocated populations to investigate the relative utility of three bottleneck detection methods. With this dataset, only assessment of the modal allele frequency distribution, described by Luikart et?al. Journal of Heredity, 89, 238247 (1998), provided evidence of a bottleneck in the absence of source population data.},

The methodology is based on our own modifications of the Institute of Healthcare Improvement "Breakthrough Series" and the Northern New England Cystic Fibrosis Consortium. Because of similarities across practices and the availability of existing published practice parameters, the clinical genetics evaluation of the child with developmental delay or intellectual disability was chosen as the topic to be studied. The aim was to improve the rate of etiological diagnosis of those with developmental delays referred to each genetics center by improving the processes of care. Process and outcomes were evaluated. Four of five sites also evaluated the impact of array comparative genomic hybridization (a-CGH) laboratory testing of such patients. There was significant site-to-site variation in the rate of new diagnoses by a-CGH with the average new diagnosis rate of 11.8{\%} (range 5.4-28.8{\%}). Barriers to implementation of the process and outcome data collection and analysis were significant and related to time pressures, lack of personnel or staff to support this activity, and competing quality improvement initiatives at the institutional home of some genetics centers.},

@article{Mollet2010,
	abstract = {We present a new methodology to estimate rates of energy acquisition, maintenance, reproductive investment and the onset of maturation (four-trait estimation) by fitting an energy allocation model to individual growth trajectories. The accuracy and precision of the method is evaluated on simulated growth trajectories. In the deterministic case, all life history parameters are well estimated with negligible bias over realistic parameter ranges. Adding environmental variability reduces precision, causes the maintenance and reproductive investment to be confounded with a negative error correlation, and tends, if strong, to result in an underestimation of the energy acquisition and maintenance and an overestimation of the age and size at the onset of maturation. Assuming a priori incorrect allometric scaling exponents also leads to a general but fairly predictable bias. To avoid confounding in applications we propose to assume a constant maintenance (three-trait estimation), which can be obtained by fitting reproductive investment simultaneously to size at age on population data. The results become qualitatively more robust but the improvement of the estimate of the onset of maturation is not significant. When applied to growth curves back-calculated from otoliths of female North Sea plaice Pleuronectes platessa, the four-trait and three-trait estimation produced estimates for the onset of maturation very similar to those obtained by direct observation. The correlations between life-history traits match expectations. We discuss the potential of the methodology in studies of the ecology and evolution of life history parameters in wild populations.},

	abstract = {There is substantial debate over the criteria that should be used to group populations of a species into distinct units for conservation (e.g. evolutionarily significant units, management units, distinct population segments). However, in practice molecular genetic differentiation is often the only or main criterion used to identify such units. Most genetic studies attempting to define conservation units in animals use a single molecular marker, most often mitochondrial, and use samples from a limited number of populations throughout the species' range. Although there are many benefits to using mtDNA, certain features can cause it to show patterns of differentiation among populations that do not reflect the history of differentiation at the nuclear genome where loci controlling traits of adaptive significance presumably occur. Here we illustrate an example of such mitochondrial-nuclear discordance in a ranid frog, and show how using mtDNA or nuclear loci alone could have led to very different conservation recommendations. We also found very high genetic differentiation among populations on a local scale, and discuss the conservation implications of our results.},

	abstract = {Maintaining wild-type (WT) zebrafish stocks for research while preserving viability within the lines used presents significant challenges to zebrafish husbandry practices. Genetic homogeneity is established through inbreeding to provide continuity across experiments. This, however, leads to decreased fitness through inbreeding depression. In the laboratory setting, it is imperative that researchers consistently obtain a large number of viable embryos; thus, inbreeding depression must be suppressed. Genetic variation can be established by creating hybrid lines; however, crosses between genetically distinct lines can cause an outbreeding depression as well. There is little data describing the effects of inbreeding depression or outbreeding depression from such crosses in zebrafish. Additionally, there is a need to establish breeding standards within the zebrafish field. This study examines the susceptibility to inbreeding and outbreeding depression in crosses between four WT zebrafish lines: the inbred lines AB and Tab 14, and the F1 generation of hybrid lines TuAB and TLAB. We report that mating frequency and clutch size were significantly greater in hybrid female crosses than in inbred female crosses. Inbreeding depression in common zebrafish lines such as AB and Tab 14 used here results in fewer successful matings and smaller clutch sizes. Further, outbreeding depression caused by crossing distantly related lines, such as the inbred Tab 14 and the hybrid TLAB lines, can also influence successful zebrafish mating. These data provide evidence needed to further characterize commonly used WT zebrafish lines. We suggest that to maintain lines that mate frequently and yield large clutches, hybrid females of known backgrounds should be used.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic habitat fragmentation--ubiquitous in modern ecosystems--has strong impacts on gene flow and genetic population structure. Reptiles may be particularly susceptible to the effects of fragmentation because of their extreme sensitivity to environmental conditions and limited dispersal. We investigate fine-scale spatial genetic structure, individual relatedness, and sex-biased dispersal in a large population of a long-lived reptile (tuatara, Sphenodon punctatus) on a recently fragmented island. We genotyped individuals from remnant forest, regenerating forest, and grassland pasture sites at seven microsatellite loci and found significant genetic structuring (R(ST)=0.012) across small distances ({\textless}500 m). Isolation by distance was not evident, but rather, genetic distance was weakly correlated with habitat similarity. Only individuals in forest fragments were correctly assignable to their site of origin, and individual pairwise relatedness in one fragment was significantly higher than expected. We did not detect sex-biased dispersal, but natural dispersal patterns may be confounded by fragmentation. Assignment tests showed that reforestation appears to have provided refuges for tuatara from disturbed areas. Our results suggest that fine-scale genetic structuring is driven by recent habitat modification and compounded by the sedentary lifestyle of these long-lived reptiles. Extreme longevity, large population size, simple social structure and random dispersal are not strong enough to counteract the genetic structure caused by a sedentary lifestyle. We suspect that fine-scale spatial genetic structuring could occur in any sedentary species with limited dispersal, making them more susceptible to the effects of fragmentation.},

	abstract = {Genetic diversity of populations has important ecological and evolutionary consequences, whose understanding is fundamental to improve the sustainability of agricultural production. Studies of how differences in agricultural management and environment influence the population structure of insect pests are central to predict outbreaks and optimize control programs. Here, we have studied the population genetic diversity and evolution of Sitobion avenae and Sitobion miscanthi, which are among the most relevant aphid pests of cereals across Europe and Asia, respectively. We have used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to identify genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to infer the geographic structure and migration patterns. In the present study, we show that the population structure in present-day populations is different from that described in previous studies, which suggest that they have evolved recently possibly as a response to human-induced changes in agriculture. This study shows that S. avenae in England is predominantly parthenogenetic and there has been a demographic and spatial expansion of a single genetic cluster, which could correspond with the insecticide resistance superclone identified in previous studies. Conversely, in China, S. miscanthi populations are mostly cyclical parthenogenetic, with one sexual stage in autumn to produce overwintering eggs, and there are six genetically differentiated subpopulations and high genetic differentiation between geographic locations, which suggests that further taxonomical research is needed. Unlike S. avenae in England, there is no evidence for insecticide resistance and there is no predominance of a single lineage in S. miscanthi in China.},

Ixodes uriae were distributed nonrandomly on nestlings within and among sites. Soil substrate was thought to be an important factor influencing tick distribution. Nestlings with severe tick infestation had slower rates of wing growth, reached peak mass at older ages, and fledged with shorter wings at older ages than nestlings with fewer ticks. By remaining in the nest for longer periods, nestlings with severe tick infestation may have been compensating for the delay in wing development.},

	abstract = {Faeces play a role in intraspecific chemical communication in many vertebrates, including lizards. Here, we hypothesised that juvenile Iberian rock lizards (Lacerta (=Iberolacerta) monticola) use substrate-borne conspecific faecal chemicals to assess the social environment and base their spatial decisions. To test this hypothesis, we prepared chemical stimuli by dissolving faeces in an organic solvent (dichloromethane, DCM) and conducted chemosensory trials where we quantified latency to the first tongue flick (TF) and TF rates when young captive-borne juveniles were placed in an arena compartment whose substrate was labelled by (1) a control (DCM), (2) their own faecal chemicals, (3) faecal chemicals of another juvenile, (4) faecal chemicals of an adult female or (5) faecal chemicals of an adult male. Following TF observations, we removed a partition that separated the labelled compartment from a chemically unlabelled one, and recorded for 5 min when juveniles first crossed to the unlabelled compartment and total time spent in the labelled compartment. Each juvenile was tested with all stimuli in a randomised order. In addition, juveniles belonged to different families and were unrelated to and unfamiliar with faeces donors. Taken together, TF and spatial responses toward stimuli indicate that juveniles discriminated between faecal chemicals of conspecific juveniles, adult females and males, and that they avoided remaining in substrates labelled by adult male faecal chemicals. We suggest that juveniles assess the social environment based on conspecific faecal chemicals thus avoiding aggression and cannibalistic risks undertaken from encounters with adult males.},

Here I consider how best to incorporate knowledge of evolutionary processes and the distribution of genetic diversity into conservation planning and priority setting for populations within species and for biogeographic areas within regions. Separation of genetic diversity into two dimensions, one concerned with adaptive variation and the other with neutral divergence caused by isolation, highlights different evolutionary processes and suggests alternative strategies for conservation. Planning for both species and areas should emphasize protection of historically isolated lineages (Evolutionarily Significant Units) because these cannot be recovered. By contrast, adaptive features may best be protected by maintaining the context for selection, heterogeneous landscapes, and viable populations, rather than protecting specific phenotypes. A useful strategy may be to (1) identify areas that are important to represent species and (vicariant) genetic diversity and (2) maximize within these areas the protection of contiguous environmental gradients across which selection and migration can interact to maintain population viability and (adaptive) genetic diversity. These concepts are illustrated with recent results from analysis of a rainforest fauna from northeast Australia.},

@article{Moritz1999,
	abstract = {The setting of conservation priorities within species requires explicit goals and identification of the appropriate targets for conservation. I suggest that the conservation goal should be to conserve ecological and evolutionary processes; rather than to preserve specific phenotypic variants - the products of those processes. From this perspective, we should seek to conserve historically isolated, and thus independently evolving, sets of populations (i.e., Evolutionarily Significant Units, ESU). This can require manipulation of the component Management Units (MUs), some of which may be phenotypically distinct. Here I explore the application of this approach to the design of translocations for conservation management. A process-oriented approach suggests that individuals should not be translocated between ESUs, but under some circumstances it is appropriate to mix individuals from different MUs within an ESU. These circumstances include augmentation of remnant populations that are showing signs of inbreeding depression or increased fragmentation and the use of mixed stocks for reintroductions into modified or changing environments or for introductions into novel environments. These actions are consistent with the goal of maintaining processes, but the extent to which differences in adaptation or coadaptation constrain the viability of populations subject to translocation needs further exploration. Both theory and limited experimental evidence suggests that these constraints can be overcome if sufficient genetic variation is present and evolutionary processes can operate without substantially reducing population viability. One remaining question is the extent to which genetic coadaptation, and the resulting outbreeding depression, develops along environmental gradients and how this compares to the build-up of genetic incompatibility between historically isolated populations.},

@article{Moritz1994a,
	abstract = {Patterns of variation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) increasingly are being investigated in threatened or managed species, but not always with clearly defined goals for conservation. In this review I identify uses of mtDNA analysis which fall into two different areas: (i) 'gene conservation' - the identification and management of genetic diversity, and (ii) 'molecular ecology' - the use of mtDNA variation to guide and assist demographic studies of populations. These two classes of application have different conceptual bases, conservation goals and time-frames. Gene conservation makes extensive use of phylogenetic information and is, in general, most relevant to long-term planning. Appropriate uses here include identification of Evolutionarily Significant Units and assessment of conservation priority of taxa or areas from an evolutionary perspective. Less appropriate are inferences about fitness from within-population diversity and about species boundaries. Molecular ecology makes more use of allele frequencies and provides information useful for short-term management of populations. Powerful applications are to identify Management Units and to define and use naturally occurring genetic tags, Estimating demographic parameters, e.g migration rate and population size, from patterns of mtDNA diversity is fraught with difficulty, particularly where populations are fluctuating, and is unlikely to produce quantitative estimates sufficiently accurate to be useful for practical management of contemporary populations. However, through comparative studies, mtDNA analysis can provide qualitative signals of population changes, allowing efficient targeting of resource-intensive ecological studies. Thus, there are some relatively straightforward uses of mtDNA, preferably in conjunction with assays of nuclear variation, that can make a significant contribution to the long-term planning and short-term,execution of species recovery plans.},

	abstract = {We have mapped and quantified mouse transcriptomes by deeply sequencing them and recording how frequently each gene is represented in the sequence sample (RNA-Seq). This provides a digital measure of the presence and prevalence of transcripts from known and previously unknown genes. We report reference measurements composed of 41-52 million mapped 25-base-pair reads for poly(A)-selected RNA from adult mouse brain, liver and skeletal muscle tissues. We used RNA standards to quantify transcript prevalence and to test the linear range of transcript detection, which spanned five orders of magnitude. Although {\textgreater}90{\%} of uniquely mapped reads fell within known exons, the remaining data suggest new and revised gene models, including changed or additional promoters, exons and 3' untranscribed regions, as well as new candidate microRNA precursors. RNA splice events, which are not readily measured by standard gene expression microarray or serial analysis of gene expression methods, were detected directly by mapping splice-crossing sequence reads. We observed 1.45 x 10(5) distinct splices, and alternative splices were prominent, with 3,500 different genes expressing one or more alternate internal splices.},

	abstract = {Birds are capable of carrying ticks and, consequently, tick-transmitted microorganisms over long distances and across geographical barriers such as oceans and deserts. Ticks are hosts for several species of spotted fever group rickettsiae (SFGR), which can be transmitted to vertebrates during blood meals. In this study, the prevalence of this group of rickettsiae was examined in ticks infesting migratory songbirds by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). During the 2009 and 2010 spring migration season, 2064 northward-migrating passerine songbirds were examined for ticks at Johnson Bayou, Louisiana. A total of 91 ticks was removed from 35 individual songbirds for tick species identification and spotted fever group rickettsia detection. Ticks were identified as Haemaphysalis juxtakochi (n= 38, 42{\%}), Amblyomma longirostre (n= 22, 24{\%}), Amblyomma nodosum (n= 17, 19{\%}), Amblyomma calcaratum (n= 11, 12{\%}), Amblyomma maculatum (n= 2, 2{\%}), and Haemaphysalis leporispalustris (n= 1, 1{\%}) by comparing their 12S rDNA gene sequence to homologous sequences in GenBank. Most of the identified ticks were exotic species originating outside of the United States. The phylogenetic analysis of the 71 ompA gene sequences of the rickettsial strains detected in the ticks revealed the occurrence of 6 distinct rickettsial genotypes. Two genotypes (corresponding to a total of 28 samples) were included in the Candidatus Rickettsia amblyommii clade (less than 1{\%} divergence), 2 of them (corresponding to a total of 14 samples) clustered with Rickettsia sp. "Argentina" with less than 0.2{\%} sequence divergence, and 2 of them (corresponding to a total of 27 samples), although closely related to the R. parkeri-. R. africae lineage (2.50-3.41{\%} divergence), exhibited sufficient genetic divergence from its members to possibly constitute a new rickettsial genotype. Overall, there does not seem to be a specific relationship between exotic tick species, the rickettsiae they harbor, or the reservoir competence of the corresponding bird species. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

@article{Mulcahy2008,
	abstract = {The subspecies concept has received considerable debate throughout the past century. Subspecies were originally used to delineate potential incipient species, but were later employed to simply capture geographical variation. There is a recent trend to eliminate the trinomial in light of new evidence. Discrete, diagnosable lineages are elevated to specific status, while those that show clinal variation and/or appear to represent ecological pattern classes are placed in synonymy with the parent species and the subspecific epithets are disregarded. Here, I examine the species boundaries of nightsnakes (Hypsiglena torquata) using standard phylogeographic methods and mtDNA data from 178 individuals. Previously, seventeen subspecies of H. torquata were described. In this study, I recognize six species in what was previously considered H. torquata: one is novel, two were previously recognized subspecies, while the remaining three are wide-spread, polymorphic lineages, composed of multiple subspecies. I make the case to maintain the subspecific lineages in these wide-ranging species because they are geographically cohesive, morphologically discrete, and may represent incipient species within each complex, which have not yet achieved speciation. These subspecies are maintained, not only pending future investigations, but because they provide a useful identity for the taxonomy of this diverse lineage. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Ecotourism helps to protect many habitats, but may also have negative impacts on wildlife. We investigated effects of ecotourists on reproductive success of hoatzins (Opisthocomus hoazin) and on hormonal status of their chicks in Amazonian rainforest lakes by comparing birds from undisturbed and from tourist-exposed nests. Hatching success was similar in both groups but chick survival was much lower at tourist-exposed nests than at undisturbed nests. This effect was due to an increased mortality of juveniles prior to fledging whereas small nestlings seemed largely unaffected. Juveniles, but not nestlings, living at tourist-exposed sites had a lower body mass and showed a stronger hormonal response to experimental stress compared to individuals at undisturbed sites. These data suggest that juvenile hoatzins were susceptible to tourist-induced stress which in turn may be responsible for the lower survival. In contrast, adult hoatzins that were incubating had apparently habituated to tourist presence because their flush distances at tourist-exposed nests were 50{\%} lower than at undisturbed sites. Our findings demonstrate that individuals in different life stages show different susceptibilities to tourism. We suggest that even just watching animals during breeding can threaten their survival, but a proper scientific management of off-limit zones and area-specific guidelines for wildlife observation could reduce harmful effects. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Characterization of host and parasite population genetic structure and estimation of gene flow among populations are essential for the understanding of parasite local adaptation and coevolutionary interactions between hosts and parasites. We examined two aspects of population structure in a parasitic plant, the greater dodder (Cuscuta europaea) and its host plant, the stinging nettle (Urtica dioica), using allozyme data from 12 host and eight parasite populations. First, we examined whether hosts exposed to parasitism in the past contain higher levels of genetic variation. Second, we examined whether host and parasite populations differ in terms of population structure and if their population structures are correlated. There was no evidence that host populations differed in terms of gene diversity or heterozygosity according to their history of parasitism. Host populations were genetically more differentiated (F(ST) = 0.032) than parasite populations (F(ST) = 0.009). Based on these F(ST) values, gene flow was high for both host and parasite. Such high levels of gene flow could counteract selection for local adaptation of the parasite. We found no significant correlation between geographic and genetic distance (estimated as pairwise F(ST)), either for the host or for the parasite. Furthermore, host and parasite genetic distance matrices were uncorrelated, suggesting that sites with genetically similar host populations are unlikely to have genetically similar parasite populations.},

@article{Nachman2012,
	abstract = {Recently diverged taxa may continue to exchange genes. A number of models of speciation with gene flow propose that the frequency of gene exchange will be lower in genomic regions of low recombination and that these regions will therefore be more differentiated. However, several population-genetic models that focus on selection at linked sites also predict greater differentiation in regions of low recombination simply as a result of faster sorting of ancestral alleles even in the absence of gene flow. Moreover, identifying the actual amount of gene flow from patterns of genetic variation is tricky, because both ancestral polymorphism and migration lead to shared variation between recently diverged taxa. New analytic methods have been developed to help distinguish ancestral polymorphism from migration. Along with a growing number of datasets of multi-locus DNA sequence variation, these methods have spawned a renewed interest in speciation models with gene flow. Here, we review both speciation and population-genetic models that make explicit predictions about how the rate of recombination influences patterns of genetic variation within and between species. We then compare those predictions with empirical data of DNA sequence variation in rabbits and mice. We find strong support for the prediction that genomic regions experiencing low levels of recombination are more differentiated. In most cases, reduced gene flow appears to contribute to the pattern, although disentangling the relative contribution of reduced gene flow and selection at linked sites remains a challenge. We suggest fruitful areas of research that might help distinguish between different models.},

	abstract = {Abstract  Studies in conservation genetics often attempt to determine genetic differentiation between two or more temporally or geographically distinct sample collections. Pairwise p-values from Fisher's exact tests or contingency Chi-square tests are commonly reported with a Bonferroni correction for multiple tests. While the Bonferroni correction controls the experiment-wise $\alpha$, this correction is very conservative and results in greatly diminished power to detect differentiation among pairs of sample collections. An alternative is to control the false discovery rate (FDR) that provides increased power, but this method only maintains experiment-wise $\alpha$ when none of the pairwise comparisons are significant. Recent modifications to the FDR method provide a moderate approach to determining significance level. Simulations reveal that critical values of multiple comparison tests with both the Bonferroni method and a modified FDR method approach a minimum asymptote very near zero as the number of tests gets large, but the Bonferroni method approaches zero much more rapidly than the modified FDR method. I compared pairwise significance from three published studies using three critical values corresponding to Bonferroni, FDR, and modified FDR methods. Results suggest that the modified FDR method may provide the most biologically important critical value for evaluating significance of population differentiation in conservation genetics.␣Ultimately, more thorough reporting of statistical significance is needed to allow interpretation of biological significance of genetic differentiation among populations.},

	abstract = {Movement of individual organisms is fundamental to life, quilting our planet in a rich tapestry of phenomena with diverse implications for ecosystems and humans. Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes.

@article{Naumann2000,
	abstract = {Cerro Azul is an active basaltic shield volcano forming the southwestern end of Isabela Island in the western Galapagos Archipelago. Ten eruptions have been witnessed between 1932 and 1998, an average of one eruption every 6.6 years. Although Cerro Azul has been constructed primarily by effusive Hawaiian-style eruptions, explosive hydrovolcanic eruptions have occurred intermittently from vents on the caldera floor and southern summit rim. The unique 'overturned soup plate' morphology of Galapagos shield volcanoes is well displayed at Cerro Azul. Gently dipping lower flanks with a slope of less than 4$\,^{\circ}$ steepen to over 25$\,^{\circ}$toward the summit at an average elevation of 600 m. The steep upper flanks are surmounted by a wide flat summit rim and a 450-m-deep caldera. A nested caldera geometry not seen at the other western Galapagos shields has produced a scalloped, irregular outline with excellent three-dimensional exposures of the summit structure, providing an opportunity to evaluate various models proposed for the formation of the Galapagos shields. The nesting also indicates several stages of caldera collapse with different centers of collapse, followed by partial refilling. The steep upper flanks are constructed of short, stubby pahoehoe lava flows (each 0.01-0.02 km3) erupted from circumferential vents near the summit. These flows are nearly an order of magnitude smaller in volume than the predominantly aa flows erupted from radial eruptive fissures near the break in slope (0.06-0.1 km3). The differences in volume and flow morphology with altitude are due to slower eruption rates from summit vents than from flank vents, which, in turn, are attributable to the different heights the magmas must ascend from shallow reservoirs. These observations support the contention that the steep upper flanks were constructed by the buildup of short lava flows rather than by the structural deformation of originally gently dipping flanks. In addition to the higher eruption rates, a subdued lower flank geometry is promoted by the deposition of lava deltas onto the shallow Galapagos platform on the western, northern, and eastern flanks of the volcano. 40Ar/39Ar geochronology and volume estimates show that, despite their morphologic differences, the growth of the western Galapagos shields has been nearly synchronous, precluding an evolutionary model for their development.

It is defined as D = --logeI, where I is the normalized identity of genes between two populations. This genetic distance measures the accumulated allele differences per locus. If the rate of gene substitution per year is constant, it is linearly related to the divergence time between populations under sexual isolation. It is also linearly related to geographical distance or area in some migration models. Since D is a measure of the accumulated number of codon differences per locus, it can also be estimated from data on aimino acid sequences in proteins even for a distantly related species. Thus, if enough data are available, genetic distance between any pair of organisms can be measured in terms of D. This measure is applicable to any kind of orgamnism without regard to ploidy or mating scheme.},

	abstract = {Long neglected by classic island biogeographical theory, speciation within and among islands is increasingly recognized as a major contributor to insular diversity. Although the factors responsible for island speciation remain poorly understood, this process appears critically dependent on geographical variation and speciation in allopatry or parapatry. Here, we investigate geographical variation and speciation in a complex of Hispaniolan trunk anoles (Anolis distichus), where populations with strikingly distinct dewlap colours and patterns correspond with deeply divergent mtDNA structure. Using a multilocus, population-level analysis, we investigate whether these phenotypically and mitochondrially distinct populations exhibit the type of nuclear differentiation expected among species or incipient species. Along a transect that extends across a recently recessed marine barrier, our results are consistent with the persistence of an abrupt phenotypic and mitochondrial transition following secondary contact, in spite of little or no evidence for a reduction in nuclear gene flow. Along a second transect extending across a steep environmental gradient, our phenotypic and microsatellite data suggest a sharp genetic break with little or no admixture, whereas mtDNA recovers a signature of extensive unidirectional introgression. Together, these results are consistent with previous studies of Lesser Antillean anoles, suggesting that allopatric divergence alone is insufficient for speciation, whereas reduced gene flow and partial reproductive isolation may accumulate in the presence of ecological gradients.},

For example, dispersal away from relatives may reduce survival. How these conflicting selection pressures are resolved is challenging to investigate, but theoretical models predict that inbreeding should occur frequently in some systems. Despite this, few studies have found evidence of regular incest in mammals, even in social species where relatives are spatio-temporally clustered and opportunities for inbreeding frequently arise. We used genetic parentage assignments together with relatedness data to quantify inbreeding rates in a wild population of banded mongooses, a cooperatively breeding carnivore. We show that females regularly conceive to close relatives, including fathers and brothers. We suggest that the costs of inbreeding avoidance may sometimes outweigh the benefits, even in cooperatively breeding species where strong within-group incest avoidance is considered to be the norm.},

	abstract = {The co-evolution between hosts and parasites has long been recognized as a fundamental driver of macro-evolutionary patterns of diversification. The effect of co-differentiation on parasite diversification is, however, often confounded by underlying geographic patterns of host distribution. In order to disentangle the confounding effects of allopatric versus host speciation, the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene was sequenced in seventy individuals of the parasitic nematode genus Heligmosomoides sampled in the six Apodemus mice species common in the western Palearctic region. The nuclear internal transcribed spacers (ITS) 1 and 2 were also sequenced in fifteen parasites to confirm the mitochondrial data. All lineages differentiated according to a geographic pattern and independently from the sampled host species. This suggests that host speciation did not involve concurrent parasite speciation. However, the geographic distribution range of some parasite lineages mirrors that of A. sylvaticus lineages in SW Europe, and that of A. flavicollis lineages in the Balkans and in the Middle East. Thus, regional co-differentiation likely occurred between the parasite and the two sister Apodemus hosts in different parts of their distribution range. We suggest that differences in regional abundances of A. sylvaticus and A. flavicollis are responsible for generating this pattern of regional co-differentiation. This study highlights the importance of integrating both geography and biogeographic information from potential hosts to better understand their parasite phylogeography. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, it has been suggested that genetic information from some parasites can complement genetic data from their hosts. This approach relies upon the hypothesis that such parasites share a common history with their host. In some cases, parasites provide an additional source of information because parasite data can better reconstruct the common history. Here, we discuss which parasite traits are important in determining their usefulness for analysing host history. The key is the matching of the traits of the parasite (e.g. effective population size, generation time, mutation rate and level of host specificity) with the timescales (phylogenetic, phylogeographic and demographic) that are relevant to the issues of concern in host history. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The fungus-growing termites have secondarily colonized Madagascar and only a subset of the genera found in Africa is found on this isolated island. Successful long-distance colonization may have been severely constrained by the obligate interaction of the termites with fungal symbionts and the need to acquire these symbionts secondarily from the environment for most species (horizontal symbiont transmission). Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that all extant species of fungus-growing termites of Madagascar are the result of a single colonization event of termites belonging to one of the only two groups with vertical symbiont transmission, and we date this event at approximately 13 Mya (Middle/Upper Miocene). Vertical symbiont transmission may therefore have facilitated long-distance dispersal since both partners disperse together. In contrast to their termite hosts, the fungal symbionts have colonized Madagascar multiple times, suggesting that the presence of fungus-growing termites may have facilitated secondary colonizations of the symbiont. Our findings indicate that the absence of the right symbionts in a new environment can prevent long-distance dispersal of symbioses relying on horizontal symbiont acquisition.},

The requirement that partners are able to find and recognize each other after independent reproduction is likely to severely constrain long distance dispersal. In support of this hypothesis, we have recently shown that a single colonisation of Madagascar by fungus-growing termites has occurred. The successful colonizers belong to the genus Microtermes, known to inherit their symbiont from the parental colony (vertical transmission). However, the fungal symbionts of Madagascar were not monophyletic, as expected under strict vertical transmission. Here we further discuss these findings, and we suggest further bottlenecks to dispersion and propose a transient window for horizontal transmission for the otherwise vertically transmitted Termitomyces strains.},

Genetic analysis using mitochondrial DNA and six microsatellite loci were performed. Results revealed that genomotype frequencies vary greatly, because some populations were mainly composed of A. laterale, whereas unisexuals were clearly predominant in other populations. Diploid, triploid, and putative tetraploid unisexuals were found in some of the populations. One of the populations analyzed seems to be composed only of LJ unisexual salamanders, raising questions about the mode of reproduction used in this population.

	abstract = {The effective population size, Ne, is an important parameter in population genetics and conservation biology. It is, however, difficult to directly estimate Ne from demographic data in many wild species. Alternatively, the use of genetic data has received much attention in recent years. In the present study, I propose a new method for estimating the effective number of breeders N-eb from a parameter of allele sharing (molecular coancestry) among sampled progeny. The bias and confidence interval of the new estimator are compared with those from a published method, i.e. the heterozygote-excess method, using computer simulation. Two population models are simulated; the noninbred population that consists of noninbred and nonrelated parents and the inbred population that is composed of inbred and related parents. Both methods give essentially unbiased estimates of Neb when applied to the noninbred population. In the inbred population, the proposed method gives a downward biased estimate, but the confidence interval is remarkably narrowed compared with that in the noninbred population. Estimate from the heterozygote-excess method is nearly unbiased in the inbred population, but suffers from a larger confidence interval. By combining the estimates from the two methods as a harmonic mean, the reliability is remarkably improved.},

	abstract = {In 1947, when Thor Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki hit ground in the Tuamotu archipelago, 102 days and approximately 4,000 km from its point of origin in South America, he inadvertently provided support for one of the most remarkable hypotheses of vertebrate dispersal. Iguanid lizards and boine snakes are ancient Gondwanan lineages whose distribution has been demonstrated to have been influenced by continental drift. Their enigmatic presence on the islands of the Pacific, however, has drawn fantastical conclusions of more than 8,000-km rafting from the Americas. We reexamine the hypothesis of dispersal in light of new molecular data and divergence time estimates. Our results suggest an early Paleogene (50-60 million years) divergence of these groups and the plausibility of an Asiatic or Australian (over land) source. Because the subfossil record indicates that iguanas (but not snakes) were a primary food source of island inhabitants, the absence of these species from islands with a longer history of human presence is unsurprising. Together these findings are taken as evidence of the influence humans have had on these taxa and are put forth as an example of anthropogenic obfuscation of biogeographic history. We suggest that this history is one of terrestrial connections permitting the colonization of the islands of the Pacific.},

Such regions have been called 'islands of speciation' because of their presumed role in maintaining the integrity of species despite gene flow elsewhere in the genome. Here, we review alternative explanations for such patterns. Segregation of ancestral variation or artifacts of nucleotide diversity within species can readily lead to higher F(ST) in regions of restricted recombination than other parts of the genome, even in the complete absence of interspecies gene flow, and thereby cause investigators to erroneously conclude that islands of speciation exist. We conclude by discussing strengths and weaknesses of various means for testing the role of restricted recombination in maintaining species.},

@article{Nordlie1973,
	abstract = {The two westernmost Gal{\'{a}}pagos Islands, Isabela and Fernandina, comprise six large, active, basaltic shield volcanoes, which are closely related in space and in the time of their formation. The volcanoes have marked morphological and structural similarities, but gradational differences exist which show relative volcano ages. These features also indicate the mechanisms of volcano origin and development. The unusual subaerial profiles are typified by steep upper slopes and a broad, flat top. Profiles, including submarine portions, show that all six volcanoes have four slope segments: two submarine and two subaerial. Distinct profile differences provide evidence for various formational processes; the subaerial upper segments are sensitive indicators of these processes. Superimposed profiles show that erupted lavas move far down the volcano slopes to be deposited on the subaerial lower segment and especially on the submarine segments. Relative slope maturities on a volcano can be determined that depend upon the volume of lava added to different profile directions. Different ranges of slope maturities indicate the relative volcano ages. Subaerial profiles are influenced by the submarine base which formed prior to subaerial accumulation. The "flattish" volcano tops are mostly large calderas, although some calderas are surrounded by a wide, flat rim area. Caldera characteristics, such as diameter, circularity, and depth, show trends which agree with the age sequence determined from the profiles. Volcano elevations decrease regularly with increasing caldera diameter. A radial fissure pattern is well developed on the younger volcanoes but becomes less well defined with age. When present, this pattern is restricted to the subaerial upper segment of the volcano. Fissures on subaerial lower segments have a linear nature; they extend upslope to the calderas and downslope to link adjacent volcanoes. A circumferential fissure pattern around the caldera is well displayed by some volcanoes. The diameter of the circumferential fissure pattern increases with age; on the youngest volcano, circumferential fissures have a strong linear nature. Coalescence of circumferential and linear fissures, caldera elongation, and eruption locations define dominant, throughgoing lineaments which cross each volcano and link the six volcanic centers. Subordinate lineaments can also be defined which intersect dominant lineaments at each caldera. Two lineament orientations are present which c{\ldots}},

	abstract = {The 'ecological opportunity' hypothesis predicts that when interspecific competition or predation is reduced, populations will exhibit increases in phenotypic variance as a result of colonization and adaptation to vacant or underutilized ecological niches (i.e. character release). We assessed this hypothesis by examining morphological diversity within stickleback populations in 40 undisturbed lakes from six islands off the mid-coast of British Columbia, Canada. Because larger lakes with well-developed littoral and limnetic zones will have greater trophic niche diversity than smaller lakes with only littoral zones, we predicted a positive association between lake size and variation in trophic morphology. Conversely, reduced vertebrate predation in small bog lakes allows increased variance in defensive structures without costs to fitness. Consistent with both predictions, we observed that phenotypic variance in two traits that are involved in feeding (gape width and pectoral fin length) increased with lake size while variability in defence structures (lateral plate number and dorsal spine length) was inversely related to lake size. Moreover, increased variance in defence morphology was accentuated in populations with severe armour reduction (spine loss, decreased plate overlap), another strong indicator of reduced vertebrate predation. In the majority of cases, these patterns were repeatable among islands, independent from the geographical distance between lakes, and arose from a combination of high variance within each of the sexes and increases in sexual dimorphism. These findings suggest that character release can be trait-specific and reflect the combined effects of competition, predation and habitat heterogeneity. {\textcopyright} 2005 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2005, 86, 2972013308.},

@article{Nosil2005a,
	abstract = {The classification of reproductive isolating barriers laid out by Dobzhansky and Mayr has motivated and structured decades of research on speciation. We argue, however, that this classification is incomplete and that the unique contributions of a major source of reproductive isolation have often been overlooked. Here, we describe reproductive barriers that derive from the reduced survival of immigrants upon reaching foreign habitats that are ecologically divergent from their native habitat. This selection against immigrants reduces encounters and thus mating opportunities between individuals from divergently adapted populations. It also reduces the likelihood that successfully mated immigrant females will survive long enough to produce their hybrid offspring. Thus, natural selection against immigrants results in distinctive elements of premating and postmating reproductive isolation that we hereby dub "immigrant inviability." We quantify the contributions of immigrant inviability to total reproductive isolation by examining study systems where,multiple components of reproductive isolation have been measured and demonstrate that these contributions are frequently greater than those of traditionally recognized reproductive barriers. The relevance of immigrant inviability is further illustrated by a consideration of population-genetic theory, a review of selection against immigrant alleles in hybrid zone studies, and an examination of its participation in feedback loops that influence the evolution of additional reproductive barriers. Because some degree of immigrant inviability will commonly exist between populations that exhibit adaptive ecological divergence, we emphasize that these barriers play critical roles in ecological modes of speciation. We hope that the formal recognition of immigrant inviability and our demonstration of its evolutionary importance will stimulate more explicit empirical studies of its contributions to speciation.},

	abstract = {Inbreeding and loss of genetic variation are considered to be major threats to small and endangered populations. The reduction of fitness due to inbreeding is believed to be more severe under stressful environmental conditions. We generated nine strains of the ecotoxicological model organism Chironomus riparius of different inbreeding levels in order to test the hypothesis that the inbreeding level and thus the degree of genome-wide homozygosity influences the life-history under cadmium exposure. Therefore, midge populations were exposed to a gradient of sediment-bound cadmium. The level of genetic variation in the used strains was assessed using microsatellite markers. In the life-cycle tests, inbreeding reduced fitness within C. riparius populations both under control and stressed conditions. However, differences between genetically diverse and impoverished strains were greatest at high cadmium exposure. Overall, inbreeding effects were not only dependent on cadmium concentrations in the sediment, but also on the life-history trait investigated. While some parameters where only affected by inbreeding, others were altered by both, inbreeding and cadmium. For the larval developmental time, a significant interaction was found between inbreeding and cadmium stress. While all strains showed a similar developmental time under control conditions, high rates of inbreeding led to a significantly delayed emergence time under high cadmium concentrations, resulting in longer generation periods and reduced population growth rates as population-relevant effects. The results show, that bioassays with C. riparius are affected by the level of inbreeding within Chironomus test strains. Pollution stress is therefore likely to affect the survival of rare and endangered populations more severe than that of large and genetically diverse ones. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

A shortening of the manus precedes the attenuation of other wing-bone elements in the evolution of flightlessness in birds. -Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 91: 115-122 This is the first study to present evidence for a general pattern of wing-bone attenuation during the early stages of the evolution of flightlessness. A comparative analysis using phylogenetic independent contrasts showed that in families that contain both flighted (volant) and flightless species, the volant species have shorter wings and total-arm (humerus + ulna + manus) lengths relative to their body masses than the species within their wholly volant sister families. A shortening of the manus may typify the early stages of the evolution of flightlessness, with the humerus and ulna attenuating later, perhaps because of their role in maintaining the position of the aerodynamically important alula. A shorter wing relative to body mass was not the result of the inverse (i.e. heavier body mass relative to wing length) because mean body masses of volant members of flightless families were similar to or lower than those of their wholly volant sister families. Despite finding a common trend in the wing morphologies of volant members of flightless families, it seems unlikely that a general model of selection pressures driving the evolution of flightlessness exists. At the very least, a dichotomy between those birds that have lost the ability to fly in order to gain the ability to swim and terrestrial forms, may persist.},

	abstract = {In a constantly changing environment, organisms must continuously adapt or face extinction. J. B. S. Haldane argued that the "cost of natural selection" (also called the cost of substitution) puts an upper limit on the rate of adaptation, and showed that the cost (C) was a decreasing function of the initial frequency of the beneficial alleles. Based on mutation-selection balance and 10{\%} selective mortality, he suggested that the limit to adaptive evolution was about one allelic substitution per 300 generations. I have tested Haldane's results using simulations of a population limited by density-dependent regulation and subject to a constantly changing environment that affects n (= 1-7) independent survival traits, each controlled by a single locus. I investigated the influence of carrying capacity (K), mutation rate (it), number of beneficial mutations per generation (approximated by M = 2Ku) and net reproductive rate (R). Of these, M has the predominant influence. The effect of large changes in R was relatively small. The cost of selection (C) was measured as the shortest number of generations between an allelic substitution at all loci under selection that was consistent with population persistence. The results differed from Haldane's solution. Across a range of conditions, the cost of Simultaneous selection at n loci was determined by the linear relationship C = C-0(M) + nC(1)(M), where C-0(M) is the intercept and C-1(M) is the slope of the linear regression of C on n, for a given M. The intercept defined a positive fixed cost of substitution, that appears to reflect genetic deaths occurring during the stochastic phase when the beneficial alleles are rare. For M {\textgreater} 1/2, the cost of natural selection is substantially less than Haldane's estimate; however, when M {\textless} 1/2, the cost (and particularly the fixed cost) increases in an accelerating fashion as M is lowered. This result has important implications for conserved populations, since for u approximate to 5 x 10(-6) the carrying capacity of the population must be 50000 for M = 1/2. To avoid low M, smaller populations should be linked together into a large metapopulation whenever possible. This large unit would be capable of adapting when the isolated parts could not. It also suggests that if M much less than 1, small gains in K through increases in habitat can have a very large positive influence on the future survival of the population in a changing environment.},

To date, inferences of human population structure have primarily been made with common variants. However, recent large-scale resequencing studies have shown an abundance of rare variation in humans, which may be particularly useful for making inferences of fine-scale population structure. To this end, we used an information theory framework and extensive coalescent simulations to rigorously quantify the informativeness of rare and common variation to detect signatures of fine-scale population structure. We show that rare variation affords unique insights into patterns of recent population structure. Furthermore, to empirically assess our theoretical findings, we analyzed high-coverage exome sequences in 6,515 European and African American individuals. As predicted, rare variants are more informative than common polymorphisms in revealing a distinct cluster of European-American individuals, and subsequent analyses demonstrate that these individuals are likely of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Our results provide new insights into the population structure using rare variation, which will be an important factor to account for in rare variant association studies.},

	abstract = {The role of inbreeding depression in the extinction of wild populations is controversial, largely because there are no quantitative estimates of its impact using realistic levels of inbreeding depression. To address this deficiency, this study (1) provides a comprehensive estimate of the impact of inbreeding depression on wild, mammalian and avian species via a meta-analysis, and (2) determines the impact of this level of inbreeding depression on extinction risk over a broad taxonomic range via stochastic computer projections with and without inbreeding depression for populations with carrying capacities of 100, 500 and 2000 individuals. An average overall effect of 12 diploid lethal equivalents was found across the life-history of the species in the meta-analysis. In the stochastic computer projections, 12 diploid lethal equivalents of inbreeding depression (with purging) decreased median times to extinction by an average of 37{\%}. These decreases were significant and of very similar magnitude, regardless of the carrying capacity modelled. Disregarding the influence of inbreeding depression on extinction risk will lead to serious overestimates of the survival prospects of threatened mammalian and avian taxa. Further, inappropriate recovery plans may be instituted if the causes of extinction risk and their relative contributions are not recognized. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Here we present the genome sequence of Rickettsia bellii, the earliest diverging species of known rickettsiae. The 1,552,076 base pair-long chromosome does not exhibit the colinearity observed between other rickettsia genomes, and encodes a complete set of putative conjugal DNA transfer genes most similar to homologues found in Protochlamydia amoebophila UWE25, an obligate symbiont of amoebae. The genome exhibits many other genes highly similar to homologues in intracellular bacteria of amoebae. We sought and observed sex pili-like cell surface appendages for R. bellii. We also found that R. bellii very efficiently multiplies in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and survives in the phagocytic amoeba, Acanthamoeba polyphaga. These results suggest that amoeba-like ancestral protozoa could have served as a genetic "melting pot" where the ancestors of rickettsiae and other bacteria promiscuously exchanged genes, eventually leading to their adaptation to the intracellular lifestyle within eukaryotic cells.},

	abstract = {The relationship between genetic diversity and fitness has important implications in evolutionary and conservation biology. This relationship has been widely investigated at the individual level in studies of heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFC). General effects caused by inbreeding and/or local effects at single loci have been used as explanations of HFC, but the debate about the causes of HFC in open, natural populations is still ongoing. Study designs that control for variation in the inbreeding level of the individuals, and knowledge on the function and location of the markers used to measure heterozygosity, are fundamental to understand the causes of HFC. Here we investigated correlations between individual heterozygosity and estimates of survival at different life-history stages in an open population of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). For survival at the embryo, nestling and fledgling stage, we used a full-sibling approach, i.e. we controlled for the level of inbreeding. We genotyped 1496 individuals with 79 microsatellites mapped across 25 chromosomes in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) that were classified either as potentially functional (58 loci) or as neutral (21 loci). We found different effects of standardized multilocus heterozygosity (SH): SH(functional) had a negative effect on the probability of hatching and local recruitment of females, whereas SH(neutral) had a positive effect on adult survival. The negative effects of functional loci are better explained by local effects, whereas the positive effects of neutral markers could reflect inbreeding effects in the population. Our results highlight the importance of considering the characteristics of the markers used in HFC studies and confirm the mixed effects of heterozygosity in different contexts (e.g. sex and life-history stage).},

	abstract = {Although it is well established that many insects, birds and mammals serve as important pollinators and seed dispersers of flowering plants, the role of lizards in these processes has traditionally been considered as rare and less important. However, recent work shows both that their role as mutualistic agents has been underestimated and also reveals a striking pattern - that pollination and seed dispersal by lizards is most common on islands. We argue that this island phenomenon occurs because island lizards reach very high densities (density compensation) and experience a lower predation risk than do those on the mainland and, consequently, can expand their diet to include nectar, pollen and fruit. Although further empirical evidence is needed to confirm this explanation, such relationships could be ideal systems with which to study fundamental ecological problems, such as niche shifts, ecological release and competition.},

@article{Olsson2006,
	abstract = {Resource competition has been hypothesized to be important in driving divergence by natural selection. The effect of competition on morphological divergence and plasticity has however rarely been investigated. Since low growth rates might constrain morphological modulation and individual growth rates usually are negatively related to the intensity of competition, there might be a connection between competition, growth rate and morphological divergence. We performed an aquarium experiment with young-of-the-year Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) to investigate how individual growth rate affected morphological plasticity induced by contrasting habitat treatments. Furthermore, in a field study of 10 lakes we also related the degree of morphological differentiation between habitats to the intraspecific competitior biomass. In the aquarium experiment we found that morphological plasticity was growth rate dependent in that morphological differentiation between the habitat treatments was confined to high individual growth rates. In the field study we found that morphological differentiation between habitats decreased with increasing intraspecific competitior biomass. Since plasticity is hypothesized to be important in divergence and intraspecific biomass could serve as a proxy for the level of competition, we suggest that our results indicate that morphological divergence might be constrained during periods of intense intraspecific competition due to low growth rates. A possible scenario is that at low growth rates all energy available is used for metabolic maintenance and no surplus energy is therefore available for morphological modulation.},

	abstract = {Intracellular pathogens have devised mechanisms to exploit their host cells to ensure their survival and replication. The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum relies on an exchange of metabolites with the host for proliferation. Here we describe a mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis of the parasite throughout its 48 hr intraerythrocytic developmental cycle. Our results reveal a general modulation of metabolite levels by the parasite, with numerous metabolites varying in phase with the developmental cycle. Others differed from uninfected cells irrespective of the developmental stage. Among these was extracellular arginine, which was specifically converted to ornithine by the parasite. To identify the biochemical basis for this effect, we disrupted the plasmodium arginase gene in the rodent malaria model P. berghei. These parasites were viable but did not convert arginine to ornithine. Our results suggest that systemic arginine depletion by the parasite may be a factor in human malarial hypoargininemia associated with cerebral malaria pathogenesis. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd. In vertebrates, one main feature of stress response is the release of glucocorticoids (corticosterone in reptiles), steroid hormones whose synthesis is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). In the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Islands, populations of land iguanas are differentially impacted by a tick-transmitted apicomplexan hemoparasite of genus Hepatozoon, which could cause diseases and ultimately reduce fitness. Using competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), we examined baseline plasma corticosterone levels of two syntopic and highly parasitized populations of the land iguana species Conolophus marthae and C. subcristatus in Wolf volcano (Isabela Island). We also used a poorly parasitized population of C. subcristatus from the same island (Bahia Urbina) as a reference. To better interpret the observed glucocorticoids patterns, we simultaneously performed the count of white blood cells (WBCs) in all individuals and investigated the reproductive status of females. We did not find evidence in support of either a positive or negative relationship between the tick load, hemoparasite infection, and glucocorticoid plasma concentration in C. marthae and C. subcristatus at Wolf volcano. The comparison between parasitized and non-parasitized sites (V. Wolf and Bahia Urbina) would instead suggest an inverse relationship between corticosterone and parasites. Our findings support association between corticosterone plasma levels and reproduction.},

Rejection of the null hypothesis implies a role for directional natural selection. This test is applicable to any character in any organism in which QTL analysis can be performed.},

For example, morphological evolution sometimes involves a modest number of genetic changes, with some individual changes having a large effect on the phenotype or fitness. Here I survey the history of adaptation theory, focusing on the rise and fall of various views over the past century and the reasons for the slow development of a mature theory of adaptation.

	abstract = {Three species of lizards (Agama agama, Mabuya perrotetii, and Sceloporus orcutti) were tested for a possible increase in mean selected body temperature (MSBT) in response to intraperitoneal injection of alcohol-killed Aeromonas sobria, a gram-negative bacterium known to be pathogenic to reptiles. A paired experimental design was utilized in which each animal was given an injection of sterile saline and 1.10(10) A. sobria. Body temperatures were monitored via indwelling cloacal thermocouples at 4-min intervals for one 12-h light period under saline injection and for two consecutive 12-h light periods under bacteria injection. Agama agama demonstrated a significant increase in MSBT on both day 1 and day 2 of bacteria injection with increases of 2.7 and 2.3 degrees C, respectively. The latency period on day 1 averaged 6.4 h. Sceloporus orcutti demonstrated a significant decrease in MSBT on day 1 of bacteria injection and a significant increase in MSBT of 1.0 degree C on day 2 of bacteria injection. No fever was evident in S. orcutti until the beginning of day 2. Mabuya perrotetii did not exhibit a significant change in MSBT on either day 1 or day 2 of bacteria injection. Agama agama (family Agamidae) is the first Old World reptile to exhibit a fever response to bacteria injection, and with these results fever has now been demonstrated in the lizard families Agamidae, Iguanidae, and Teiidae.},

	abstract = {The present study evaluated the rickettsial infection in Amblyomma parvum ticks collected in Northwestern C{\'{o}}rdoba Province, Argentina. Each tick was subjected to DNA extraction and tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting fragments of the rickettsial genes gltA and ompB. Nine (69.2{\%}) out of 13 adult ticks yielded expected PCR products for the two rickettsial genes. Products from the ompB PCR were sequenced, generating DNA sequences 100{\%} identical for the nine PCR-positive ticks. Three of these ticks were tested in another battery of PCR targeting fragments of the rickettsial genes gltA, htrA, and ompA. Products from the gltA, htrA, and ompA PCRs were sequenced generating DNA sequences 100{\%} identical for the three PCR-positive ticks. The rickettsia detected in the A. parvum ticks was designated as Rickettsia sp. strain Argentina. Phylogenetic analyses performed with partial sequences of the rickettsial genes gltA, htrA, ompB, and ompA showed that Rickettsia sp. strain Argentina belonged to the spotted fever group, being distinct from all known Rickettsia species and genotypes available in GenBank, representing possibly a new Rickettsia species. This was the first evidence of rickettsial infection in the tick A. parvum, and the third report of rickettsial infection among the Argentinean tick fauna. The role of Rickettsia sp. strain Argentina as a human pathogen is unknown. Further studies are needed to obtain tissue-cultured isolates of Rickettsia sp. strain Argentina, in order to better characterize it and to determine its taxonomic status as a new species.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rickettsia parkeri rickettsiosis, a recently identified spotted fever transmitted by the Gulf Coast tick (Amblyomma maculatum), was first described in 2004. We summarize the clinical and epidemiological features of 12 patients in the United States with confirmed or probable disease attributable to R. parkeri and comment on distinctions between R. parkeri rickettsiosis and other United States rickettsioses. METHODS: Clinical specimens from patients in the United States who reside within the range of A. maculatum for whom an eschar or vesicular rash was described were evaluated by {\textgreater} or =1 laboratory assays at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA) to identify probable or confirmed infection with R. parkeri. RESULTS: During 1998-2007, clinical samples from 12 patients with illnesses epidemiologically and clinically compatible with R. parkeri rickettsiosis were submitted for diagnostic evaluation. Using indirect immunofluorescence antibody assays, immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction assays, and cell culture isolation, we identified 6 confirmed and 6 probable cases of infection with R. parkeri. The aggregate clinical characteristics of these patients revealed a disease similar to but less severe than classically described Rocky Mountain spotted fever. CONCLUSIONS: Closer attention to the distinct clinical features of the various spotted fever syndromes that exist in the United States and other countries of the Western hemisphere, coupled with more frequent use of specific confirmatory assays, may unveil several unique diseases that have been identified collectively as Rocky Mountain spotted fever during the past century. Accurate assessments of these distinct infections will ultimately provide a more valid description of the currently recognized distribution, incidence, and case-fatality rate of Rocky Mountain spotted fever.},

This method has the advantage of making explicit the relationship between the host and parasite trees, and it allows a visually intuitive representation of that history. It also enables host switches to be incorporated as an explanation of the observed pattern of host-parasite associations, without the spurious overestimates of the number of host switches that can be obtained using Brooks parsimony analysis (BPA). Reconstructions that maximize the number of cospeciation events have the greatest explanatory power and are hence preferred over reconstructions with fewer cospeciation events. A heuristic algorithm to find a single maximal reconstruction, and an exact algorithm to find all such reconstructions are presented. Two empirical applications of the method are given.},

	abstract = {Theory predicts a significant relationship between the size of a population and the magnitude and composition of its genetic load, but few natural populations have been investigated. We examined the magnitude of genetic load due to recessive deleterious alleles (GL) both segregating and fixed within Gentianella germanica populations of varying size by selfing and reciprocally crossing plants within and between natural populations according to a partial diallel design and by comparing the performance of the experimental progeny in a common-garden experiment. The results show that GL for total fitness in small populations (fewer than 200 plants) was mainly due to fixed recessive deleterious alleles, whereas GL for total fitness in larger populations (more than 200 plants) appeared to be mainly due to segregating deleterious recessive alleles. The total fitness of selfed plants increased with decreasing population size, indicating some purging of deleterious alleles associated with declining population sizes. The magnitudes of GL due to fixed deleterious alleles in small populations and segregating deleterious alleles in large populations, however, were overall similar, suggesting that purging selection was an insignificant force when compared to genetic drift in determining the magnitude of GL in small natural populations in this species. The results of this study highlight the importance of population size in determining the dynamics of genetic loads of natural populations and are overall in line with a large body of theoretical work indicating that small populations may face higher extinction risks due to the fixation and accumulation of deleterious alleles of small effect.},

@article{Palstra2012,
	abstract = {With an ecological-evolutionary perspective increasingly applied toward the conservation and management of endangered or exploited species, the genetic estimation of effective population size (N(e)) has proliferated. Based on a comprehensive analysis of empirical literature from the past two decades, we asked: (i) how often do studies link N(e) to the adult census population size (N)? (ii) To what extent is N(e) correctly linked to N? (iii) How readily is uncertainty accounted for in both N(e) and N when quantifying N(e)/N ratios? and (iv) how frequently and to what degree might errors in the estimation of N(e) or N affect inferences of N(e)/N ratios? We found that only 20{\%} of available N(e) estimates (508 of 2617; 233 studies) explicitly attempted to link N(e) and N; of these, only 31{\%} (160 of 508) correctly linked N(e) and N. Moreover, only 7{\%} (41 of 508) of N(e)/N ratios (correctly linked or not) reported confidence intervals for both N(e) and N; for those cases where confidence intervals were reported for N(e) only, 31{\%} of N(e)/N ratios overlapped with 1, of which more than half also reached below N(e)/N = 0.01. Uncertainty in N(e)/N ratios thus sometimes spanned at least two orders of magnitude. We conclude that the estimation of N(e)/N ratios in natural populations could be significantly improved, discuss several options for doing so, and briefly outline some future research directions.},

	abstract = {Genetic stochasticity due to small population size contributes to population extinction, especially when population fragmentation disrupts gene flow. Estimates of effective population size (Ne) can therefore be informative about population persistence, but there is a need for an assessment of their consistency and informative relevance. Here we review the body of empirical estimates of Ne for wild populations obtained with the temporal genetic method and published since Frankham's (1995) review. Theoretical considerations have identified important sources of bias for this analytical approach, and we use empirical data to investigate the extent of these biases. We find that particularly model selection and sampling require more attention in future studies. We report a median unbiased Ne estimate of 260 (among 83 studies) and find that this median estimate tends to be smaller for populations of conservation concern, which may therefore be more sensitive to genetic stochasticity. Furthermore, we report a median Ne/N ratio of 0.14, and find that this ratio may actually be higher for small populations, suggesting changes in biological interactions at low population abundances. We confirm the role of gene flow in countering genetic stochasticity by finding that Ne correlates strongest with neutral genetic metrics when populations can be considered isolated. This underlines the importance of gene flow for the estimation of Ne, and of population connectivity for conservation in general. Reductions in contemporary gene flow due to ongoing habitat fragmentation will likely increase the prevalence of genetic stochasticity, which should therefore remain a focal point in the conservation of biodiversity.},

@article{Palumbi2003,
	abstract = {Abstract. Genetic analyses of marine population structure often find only slight geographic differentiation in species with high dispersal potential. Interpreting the significance of this slight genetic signal has been difficult because even mild genetic structure implies very limited demographic exchange between populations, but slight differentiation could also be due to sampling error. Examination of genetic isolation by distance, in which close populations are more similar than distant ones, has the potential to increase confidence in the significance of slight genetic differentiation. Simulations of one-dimensional stepping stone populations with particular larval dispersal regimes shows that isolation by distance is most obvious when comparing populations separated by 2--5 times the mean larval dispersal distance. Available data on fish and invertebrates can be calibrated with this simulation approach and suggest mean dispersal distances of 25--150 km. Design of marine reserve systems requires an understanding of larval transport in and out of reserves, whether reserves will be self-seeding, whether they will accumulate recruits from surrounding exploited areas, and whether reserve networks can exchange recruits. Direct measurements of mean larval dispersal are needed to understand connectivity in a reserve system, but such measurements are extremely difficult. Genetic patterns of isolation by distance have the potential to add to direct measurement of larval dispersal distance and can help set the appropriate geographic scales on which marine reserve systems will function well. $\backslash$nKey words: connectivity; dispersal; isolation by distance; larvae; population structure.},

@article{Pamilo1998,
	abstract = {Our aim in this study was to examine the power of associative overdominance in creating a correlation between individual heterozygosity and fitness and in maintaining genetic polymorphism at neutral loci. This was undertaken by simulating a diploid model with five chromosomes, each with 1000 loci that could have deleterious mutations linked to neutral markers located on the same chromosomes. The simulations were carried out with various combinations of the following parameters: population size (N), number of crossovers (c), selection coefficient (s) and dominance (h). All combinations of parameter values resulted in a positive regression of the fitness on the individual marker heterozygosity, although the fitness differences were not very large when c = 2. The association between individual heterozygosity and fitness was clearest for recessive mutations (small h) with intermediate selection coefficients in small populations. The level of marker heterozygosity in the population was higher than the neutral expectation for many parameter values, even though regression of fitness on heterozygosity was not always steep at the individual level. These results agreed with the conclusion that associative overdominance could help to maintain polymorphisms in small populations. Strong selection occasionally yielded gene diversities lower than the neutral expectation, reflecting the prediction that strong selection reduces the effective population size.},

	abstract = {The increasing availability of molecular and genetic databases coupled with the growing power of computers gives biologists opportunities to address new issues, such as the patterns of molecular evolution, and re-assess old ones, such as the role of adaptation in species diversification. In the second edition, the book continues to integrate a wide variety of data analysis methods into a single and flexible interface: the R language. This open source language is available for a wide range of computer systems and has been adopted as a computational environment by many authors of statistical software. Adopting R as a main tool for phylogenetic analyses will ease the workflow in biologists' data analyses, ensure greater scientific repeatability, and enhance the exchange of ideas and methodological developments. The second edition is completed updated, covering the full gamut of R packages for this area that have been introduced to the market since its previous publication five years ago. There is also a new chapter on the simulation of evolutionary data. Graduate students and researchers in evolutionary biology can use this book as a reference for data analyses, whereas researchers in bioinformatics interested in evolutionary analyses will learn how to implement these methods in R. The book starts with a presentation of different R packages and gives a short introduction to R for phylogeneticists unfamiliar with this language. The basic phylogenetic topics are covered: manipulation of phylogenetic data, phylogeny estimation, tree drawing, phylogenetic comparative methods, and estimation of ancestral characters. The chapter on tree drawing uses R's powerful graphical environment. A section deals with the analysis of diversification with phylogenies, one of the author's favorite research topics. The last chapter is devoted to the development of phylogenetic methods with R and interfaces with other languages (C and C++). Some exercises conclude these chapters.},

	abstract = {The classic evolutionary hypothesis of ecological opportunity proposes that both heterogeneity of resources and freedom from enemies promote phenotypic divergence as a response to increased niche availability. Although phenotypic divergence and speciation have often been inferred to be the primary consequences of the release from competition or predation that accompanies a shift to a new adaptive zone, increased phenotypic variation within species is expected to represent the first stage resulting from such a shift. Using measures of intraspecific morphological variation of 30 species of Gal{\'{a}}pagos endemic land snails in a phylogenetically controlled framework, we show that the number of local congeners and the number of local plant species are associated with lower and higher intraspecific phenotypic variation, respectively. In this clade, ecological opportunity thus explicitly links the role of competition from congeners and the heterogeneity of resources to the extent of intraspecific phenotypic divergence as adaptive radiation proceeds.},

	abstract = {Remote oceanic islands have long been recognized as natural models for the study of evolutionary processes involved in diversification. Their remoteness provides opportunities for isolation and divergence of populations, which make islands remarkable settings for the study of diversification. Groups of islands may share a relatively similar geological history and comparable climate, but their inhabitants experience subtly different environments and have distinct evolutionary histories, offering the potential for comparative studies. A range of organisms have colonized the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Islands, and various lineages have radiated throughout the archipelago to form unique assemblages. This review pays particular attention to molecular phylogenetic studies of Gal{\'{a}}pagos terrestrial fauna. We find that most of the Gal{\'{a}}pagos terrestrial fauna have diversified in parallel to the geological formation of the islands. Lineages have occasionally diversified within islands, and the clearest cases occur in taxa with very low vagility and on large islands with diverse habitats. Ecology and habitat specialization appear to be critical in speciation both within and between islands. Although the number of phylogenetic studies is continuously increasing, studies of natural history, ecology, evolution and behaviour are essential to completely reveal how diversification proceeded on these islands. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Royal Society.},

This phenomenon was analyzed by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis on the annual legume Amphicarpaea bracteata and its nitrogen-fixing bacterial symbionts (Bradyrhizobium sp.) sampled from {\textgreater}20 sites over a 1000 km area. Three analyses indicated that genetic differentiation was correlated in the two organisms. First, the genetic distance between bacterial populations at each pair of sites was significantly positively related to the genetic distance between their host plant populations, as evaluated by the Mantel test. Second, a cluster analysis revealed that several divergent lineages were present both among plants and among bacteria. Bacterial lineages showed a highly nonrandom distribution across plant lineages that was consistent in each of two regions sampled. Finally, there were numerous cases where populations of the same plant lineage 1000 km apart harbored bacterial isolates with an identical multilocus genotype. Thus, despite recurrent opportunities for partner switching, particular genotypes of these two organisms associate consistently across multiple habitats throughout their geographic range},

An element of this paradigm suggested that the many other characterized and noncharacterized rickettsiae isolated from ticks were not pathogenic to humans. In this context, it was considered that relatively few tick-borne rickettsiae caused human disease. This concept was modified extensively from 1984 through 2005 by the identification of at least 11 additional rickettsial species or subspecies that cause tick-borne rickettsioses around the world. Of these agents, seven were initially isolated from ticks, often years or decades before a definitive association with human disease was established. We present here the tick-borne rickettsioses described through 2005 and focus on the epidemiological circumstances that have played a role in the emergence of the newly recognized diseases.},

Several species of tick-borne rickettsiae that were considered nonpathogenic for decades are now associated with human infections, and novel Rickettsia species of undetermined pathogenicity continue to be detected in or isolated from ticks around the world. This remarkable expansion of information has been driven largely by the use of molecular techniques that have facilitated the identification of novel and previously recognized rickettsiae in ticks. New approaches, such as swabbing of eschars to obtain material to be tested by PCR, have emerged in recent years and have played a role in describing emerging tick-borne rickettsioses.

	abstract = {Population substructure has important implications for a species' ecology and evolution. As such, knowledge of this structuring is critical for the conservation and management of natural populations. Among marine mammals, many examples exist of species that enjoy a broad geographical distribution, yet are characterized by fine-scale population subdivisions. Coastal bottlenose dolphins have been studied extensively in a few regions globally, and these studies have highlighted a great diversity in both social strategies and demographic isolation. Here we use molecular genetic markers to examine the degree of population subdivision among three study sites separated by less than 250 km on Little Bahama Bank in the northern Bahamas. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence variation and microsatellite genotypes were used to assess partitioning of genetic variance among 56 individually recognized coastal ecotype bottlenose dolphins. Although resolved levels of genetic differentiation suggest gene flow among the three study sites, both nuclear and mitochondrial data indicate a significant degree of subdivision within the Little Bahama Bank population, and sex-based analyses suggest that patterns of dispersal may not be strictly biased toward males.

	abstract = {Hispaniola is the second largest island in the Caribbean and harbors an extensive amount of biodiversity. The geologic history and resulting complex topography of the island has led to significant differentiation across various taxonomic groups. Hispaniola is the only Caribbean Island with two species of Rock Iguanas, genus Cyclura. Rhinoceros Rock Iguanas (C. cornuta) are wide-ranging across Hispaniola, occurring in isolated pockets, primarily in low elevation xeric areas. To better understand the population structure of this species, we used a combination of mtDNA and nuclear markers to elucidate the genetic variation of wild populations across 13 sampling regions in the Dominican Republic (DR), as well as neighboring Mona Island, home to a Cyclura population of uncertain taxonomic status. Further, we evaluate the origin of iguanas in captive facilities throughout the DR. Our data reveal a high degree of genetic diversity across wild populations within the DR and shed light on the taxonomic status of the Mona island population. Further, novel genetic diversity is found in captive facilities, most likely resulting from interbreeding between individuals from genetically distinct populations within the captive facilities. Our results suggest that the captive facilities may pose a threat to wild populations and increased regulation of these facilities is needed.},

	abstract = {In conservation, difficult decisions concerning prioritization of different geographic areas must be made. Large-scale prioritization methods such as defining biodiversity hotspots and crisis ecoregions have paved the way; however, these efforts then need to be localized. Various approaches have been taken, such as defining evolutionarily significant units (ESUs), management units, and core habitat areas within the range of a taxonomic species. These units can then be ranked as candidates for conservation, with the goal of preserving a given species by protecting only a subset of populations. Here we used a combination of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and DNA sequence data to elucidate the relationships within and among populations of the spinytailed iguana Ctenosaura melanosterna throughout its range in Honduras. Our findings indicate that there are 2 ESUs corresponding to geographically and ecologically distinct island and mainland habitats. Management strategies consisting of translocation or captive breeding and release should not consider the island and mainland populations exchangeable. In addition, the narrow geographic range of each group suggests that no region or subpopulation is likely expendable. This study demonstrates a situation, most likely increasingly common in conservation, in which it seems that only the high priority areas remain. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2011.},

	abstract = {The growing use of molecular systematics in conservation has increased the importance of accurate resolution of taxonomic units and relationships. DNA data relate most directly to genealogies, which need not have perfect relationships with species limits and phylogenies. We used a multilocus gene tree approach to elucidate the relationships between four endangered Central American iguanas. We found support for the proposition that the described species taxa correspond to distinct evolutionary lineages warranting individual protection. We combined gene trees to estimate a phylogeny using Bayesian Estimation of Species Trees (BEST), minimizing deep coalescence, Species Trees from Average Ranks (STAR), and traditional concatenation. The estimate from concatenation conflicted with the other methods, likely owing to the disproportionate effect of mtDNA on concatenated analyses. This illustrates the importance of appropriate treatment of multilocus sequence data in phylogenetics. Our results indicate that these species have gone through recent and rapid speciation, resulting in four closely related narrow-range endemics. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {The island endemic Ctenosaura bakeri was listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Redlist Assessment in 2004, 7 years after it was recognized as a distinct species. C. bakeri occupies a portion of Utila, a small continental island located off the northern coast of Honduras. Habitat destruction and over-harvesting are among the top threats facing this species. In addition, morphological evidence of hybridization was recently documented, raising the concern that gene flow from the common and widely distributed C. similis could threaten the genetic distinctiveness of C. bakeri. We show that hybridization occurs only at low levels and is not a current threat to C. bakeri. All ctenosaurs captured for this study were identified to species level without difficulty; none had intermediate or mosaic phenotypes. Sequence analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear markers revealed only two individuals with introgressed genotypes. Molecular analysis of the previously described hybrid showed it to be heterozygous for C. bakeri and C. similis alleles. Hybridization between these two species is possible and occurs occasionally in the wild, and the rate of hybridization could increase if habitat destruction or changes in relative abundance increase the probability of interbreeding. However, the level of gene flow indicated by current data is too low to threaten C. bakeri with genetic swamping or deleterious fitness effects.},

	abstract = {Criminologists are ofren interested in examining interactive effects within a regression context. For example, ``holding other relevant factors constant, is the effect of delinquent peers on one's own delinquent conduct the same for males and females?'' or ``is the effect of a given treatment program comparable between first-time and repeat offenders?'' A frequent strategy in examining such interactive effects is to test for the difference between two regression coeficients across independent samples. That is, does b, = b,? Traditionally, criminologists have employed a t or z test for the difference between slopes in making these coeficient comparisons. While there is considerable consensus as to the appropriateness of this strategy, there has been some confusion in the criminological literature as to the correct estimator of the standard error of the difference, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of coeficient differences, in the t or z formula. Criminologists have employed two different estimators of this standard deviation in their empirical work. In this note, we point out that one of these estimators is correct while the other is incorrect. The incorrect estimator biases one's hypothesis test in favor of rejecting the null hypothesis that b, = bZ. Unfortunately, the use of this incorrect estimator of the standard error of the difference has been fairly widespread in criminology. We provide the formula for the correct statistical test and illustrate with two examples from the literature how the biased estimator can lead to incorrect conclusions.},

	abstract = {A subspecies is a collection of populations within a biological species that are diagnosably distinct from other such collections of populations. That infraspecific desig-nation has motivated a litany of spirited debates over the past half-century, from impas-sioned pleas for its retention to heated outcries for its abolition. We believe that the vast majority of attacks on the subspecies concept have resulted from displeasure with its im-proper application, not from serious flaws in the concept itself. The recognition of diagnos-able subspecies allows one to address many questions not easily answered otherwise, rang-ing from dispersal and migration to local selection and adaptation and biogeographic affinities, yet that goal was lost for many years. Many taxonomists in the late nineteenth century and first half of the twentieth century named subspecies on the basis of average differences between populations under study, a procedure at odds with identification of di-agnosable populations. To resolve that dilemma, we make explicit the established 75{\%} rule for subspecies recognition, including formalizing the rule and developing a simple statistic to test whether diagnosability is met. The equations can be adapted readily to any level of diagnosability. We apply the concept and the statistic to a revision of the subspecies of the Sage Sparrow (Amphispiza belli). Rather than the seven named subspecies or the five that are generally considered valid, we show that only three aggregates of populations are diagnos-able, and thus only three subspecies should be recognized: (1) A. b. belli in chaparral and sage scrub of coastal California, northwestern Baja California, and San Clemente Island; (2) A. b. cinerea in desert scrub of west-central Baja California; and (3) A. b. nevadensis in sage-brush and saltbush of the Great Basin and interior California. Consistent application of the 75{\%} rule will result in fewer trinomials and a more biologically meaningful and taxonomi-cally useful subspecies concept.

	abstract = {This paper explores the potential uses of new imaging techniques within conservation and their potential implications for object preservation and accessibility. Study of such implications is crucial because employment of these imaging techniques is increasingly common and becoming irreplaceable. For example, polynomial texture mapping (PTM) has revealed previously undetectable surface features; this makes it necessary to continue to use the technique to monitor object condition. 3D laser scanning and certain applications of CT scanning are also examined. The findings indicate that the techniques present some advantages over standard digital photography. The 3D models produced by laser and CT scanning, and the high-resolution texture maps created with PTM enable changes in surface features to be tracked and recorded. PTM is found to be particularly useful and affordable. A more established role within conservation, especially for condition assessments, would be worthwhile. Use of the imaging techniques to create digital and physical models for exhibitions can also be advantageous. However, such models must be used to enhance understanding of original objects, not to reduce accessibility to them.},

	abstract = {The Lahontan cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi, a listed subspecies of cutthroat trout O. clarkii, has been extirpated from over 90{\%} of its historic waters. The 1995 U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service Recovery Plan identified three evolutionarily significant units, or distinct population segments (DPSs), of Lahontan cutthroat trout based upon morphological, genetic, and ecological data. Teams composed of federal and state agency and university biologists were organized to formulate recovery strategies that were specific to each DPS. In this context, fish native to each DPS are considered exclusively for recovery activities. Lahontan cutthroat trout populations in the Willow-Whitehorse drainage of the Coyote Lake basin, Oregon, were initially identified as part of the Northwestern DPS, but recent genetic analyses suggest that these populations may warrant a fourth DPS designation. The Willow-Whitehorse Lahontan cutthroat trout are found in seven within-basin streams and have been translocated into multiple out-of-basin streams. Genetic analysis of seven populations translocated into out-of-basin streams of the Steens Mountain (Alvord Lake basin), Oregon, in the 1970s and 1980s support inclusion of these streams in any DPS-based recovery strategy for the Willow-Whitehorse Lahontan cutthroat trout. Overall gene diversity per locus was similar among translocated and source populations (Steens Mountain, 0.096-0.908; Willow-Whitehorse, 0.039-0.903). However, 135 of 300 alleles identified at 20 microsatellite loci were found in the Steens Mountain populations but not in the contemporary Willow-Whitehorse populations. The Steens Mountain populations are found in small habitats subject to the effects of genetic drift. Lahontan cutthroat trout from these out-of-basin streams should be included in conservation plans.},

	abstract = {In sexual reproduction the genetic similarity or dissimilarity between mates strongly affects offspring fitness. When mating partners are too closely related, increased homozygosity generally causes inbreeding depression, whereas crossing between too distantly related individuals may disrupt local adaptations or coadaptations within the genome and result in outbreeding depression. The optimal degree of inbreeding or outbreeding depends on population structure. A long history of inbreeding is expected to reduce inbreeding depression due to purging of deleterious alleles, and to promote outbreeding depression because of increased genetic variation between lineages. Ambrosia beetles (Xyleborini) are bark beetles with haplodiploid sex determination, strong local mate competition due to regular sibling mating within the natal chamber, and heavily biased sex ratios. We experimentally mated females of Xylosandrus germanus to brothers and unrelated males and measured offspring fitness. Inbred matings did not produce offspring with reduced fitness in any of the examined life-history traits. In contrast, outcrossed offspring suffered from reduced hatching rates. Reduction in inbreeding depression is usually attributed to purging of deleterious alleles, and the absence of inbreeding depression in X. germanus may represent the highest degree of purging of all examined species so far. Outbreeding depression within the same population has previously only been reported from plants. The causes and consequences of our findings are discussed with respect to mating strategies, sex ratios, and speciation in this unusual system.},

	abstract = {Body condition is assumed to influence an animal's health and fitness. Various non-destructive methods based on body mass and a measure of body length have been used as condition indices (CIs), but the dominant method amongst ecologists is currently the calculation of residuals from an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression of body mass against length. Recent studies of energy reserves in small mammals and starlings claimed to validate this method, although we argue that they did not include the most appropriate tests since they compared the CI with the absolute size of energy reserves. We present a novel CI (the 'scaled mass index') based on the central principle of scaling, with important methodological, biological and conceptual advantages. Through a reanalysis of data from small mammals, starlings and snakes, we show that the scaled mass index is a better indicator of the relative size of energy reserves and other body components than OLS residuals, performing better in all seven species and in 19 out of 20 analyses. We also present an empirical and theoretical comparison of the scaled mass index and OLS residuals as CIs. We argue that the scaled mass index is a useful new tool for ecologists.},

	abstract = {Understanding the effects of inbreeding and genetic drift within populations and hybridization between genetically differentiated populations is important for many basic and applied questions in ecology and evolutionary biology. The magnitudes and even the directions of these effects can be influenced by various factors, especially by the current and historical population size (i.e. inbreeding rate). Using Drosophila littoralis as a model species, we studied the effect of inbreeding rate over a range of inbreeding levels on (i) mean fitness of a population (relative to that of an outbred control population), (ii) within-population inbreeding depression (reduction in fitness of offspring from inbred versus random mating within a population) and (iii) heterosis (increase in fitness of offspring from interpopulation versus within-population random mating). Inbreeding rate was manipulated by using three population sizes (2, 10 and 40), and fitness was measured as offspring survival and fecundity. Fast inbreeding (smaller effective population size) resulted in greater reduction in population mean fitness than slow inbreeding, when populations were compared over similar inbreeding coefficients. Correspondingly, populations with faster inbreeding expressed more heterosis upon interpopulation hybridization. Inbreeding depression within the populations did not have a clear relationship with either the rate or the level of inbreeding.},

@article{Pekkala2012,
	abstract = {The negative fitness consequences of close inbreeding are widely recognized, but predicting the long-term effects of inbreeding and genetic drift due to limited population size is not straightforward. As the frequency and homozygosity of recessive deleterious alleles increase, selection can remove (purge) them from a population, reducing the genetic load. At the same time, small population size relaxes selection against mildly harmful mutations, which may lead to accumulation of genetic load. The efficiency of purging and the accumulation of mutations both depend on the rate of inbreeding (i.e., population size) and on the nature of mutations. We studied how increasing levels of inbreeding affect offspring production and extinction in experimental Drosophila littoralis populations replicated in two sizes, N = 10 and N = 40. Offspring production and extinction were measured over 25 generations concurrently with a large control population. In the N = 10 populations, offspring production decreased strongly at low levels of inbreeding, then recovered only to show a consistent subsequent decline, suggesting early expression and purging of recessive highly deleterious alleles and subsequent accumulation of mildly harmful mutations. In the N = 40 populations, offspring production declined only after inbreeding reached higher levels, suggesting that inbreeding and genetic drift pose a smaller threat to population fitness when inbreeding is slow. Our results suggest that highly deleterious alleles can be purged in small populations already at low levels of inbreeding, but that purging does not protect the small populations from eventual genetic deterioration and extinction.},

Although there are very few pathosystems for which such extensive data exist, there has been a recent push to integrate studies performed over multiple scales or to simultaneously test for dynamics occurring across scales. Drawing on examples from the literature, with primary emphasis on three diverse host--parasite case studies, we first examine current understanding of the spatial structure of host and parasite populations, including patterns of local adaptation and spatial variation in host resistance and parasite infectivity. We then explore the ways to measure temporal variation and dynamics in host--parasite interactions, and discuss the need to examine change over both ecological and evolutionary timescales. Finally, we highlight new approaches and syntheses that allow for simultaneous analysis of dynamics across scales, and argue that there is great added value in examining interplay among scales in studies of host--parasite interactions.

Evaluating the success of headstart programs is necessary but challenging. We evaluated a headstart program for the endangered Mona Island iguana Cyclura cornuta stejnegeri by analyzing demographic and spatial data and by comparing growth rate, body condition, and external parasitic load of headstarted and wild iguanas. Hatchlings were released at about 3 yr age. Minimum survival rate was 40.3 {\%}, at 7.6 to 48.3 mo after release. Most migrated from the release site back to the rearing facilities about 633 m away. Density around the rearing facility increased from 7.5 to 11.5 iguanas ha-1 (25 of 75 captures were headstarted iguanas). Released headstarted iguanas exhibited growth rates similar to the maxima observed in captive and wild mid-sized iguanas. Growth rates decreased immediately prior to release, indicating that husbandry practices ought to be reviewed. There was no evidence for an effect of captivity on susceptibility to external parasites. Increased local density indicates that the program was successful. However, the longer-term success remains unknown, as most headstarted iguanas returned to the headstart facility without establishing territories typical for adult wild Mona iguanas. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2008.},

	abstract = {The endangered iguana Cyclura cornuta stejnegeri is endemic to Mona Island, Puerto Rico. Factors accounting for its protected status include low adult densities and relatively low abundance of juveniles. We studied the spatial ecology, territoriality, and philopatric behavior along a gradient of human-disturbed areas to increase our understanding of its unusual demography. We used the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method to estimate the home range of radiomarked iguanas, the degree of inter- and intrasex home-range overlap, and the temporal patterns of space use by 42 iguanas (19 males and 23 females, including 4 juvenile individuals) during the nonbreeding (October-November) and mating season (June) at three Mona Island localities with different levels of human disturbance. Juvenile iguanas had larger home ranges and move across the home ranges of several adults. Adult males had larger home ranges than females and no significant temporal differences in size or pattern of usage (Cole index) were detected between the study periods. Females, despite reducing their home-range size during the mating season, changed the usage patterns, resulting in increased interactions with neighboring males. Home-range overlap was minimal between males, followed by female-female overlap and maximal between males and females. Our results suggest that Mona Island iguanas are highly territorial throughout the year; particularly males in the mid- and undisturbed areas where almost all home-range areas appear to be equivalent to the defended territory. In the most disturbed area, where supplemental feeding by humans exists, home ranges are smaller and there is larger intersex home-range overlap. Previously, the low density of the population was attributed to lack of recruitment into adult stages due to predation of juveniles by nonnative mammals. However, the high levels of territoriality documented in this study may be an additional factor explaining the low densities exhibited by this population. Our data suggest that the three study sites may be at or close to carrying capacities for males, because there appear to be no vacant areas for additional males. Furthermore, the large and highly overlapping home ranges exhibited by four juvenile iguanas suggest that they are or will become floaters in search of unoccupied space. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Herpetologists' League, Inc.},

No "conversion" of nonadditive into additive variance was observed, all components of the fitness genetic variance initially increasing with the inbreeding coefficient F and subsequently decreasing to zero (D) or to an equilibrium value (MSD). In the D scenario, epistasis had no appreciable effect on inbreeding depression and that on the temporal change of variance components was relevant only for high rates of strong epistatic mutation. In parallel, between-line differentiation in mean fitness accelerated with F and that in additive variance reached a maximum at F approximately 0.6-0.7, both processes being intensified by strong epistasis. In the MSD scenario, however, the increase in additive variance was smaller, as it was used by selection to purge inbreeding depression (N {\textgreater} or = 10), and selection prevented between-line differentiation.

Here, we review translocation projects, both published and unpublished. Our results indicate that most projects (1) addressed fewer than half of the basic criteria established for translo- cations and (2) were either unjustifiable from a conservation perspective or inadequately designed to guarantee success or preclude negative consequences. We propose a hierarchical decision-making system -- an explicit method that integrates existing guidelines, thereby covering a key gap in conservation science -- to reduce ambi- guity when deciding whether to implement a given translocation project. This method will improve the likeli- hood of success in translocation projects and contribute to the efficient use of the limited resources available for these conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {The best-known members of the bacterial genus Rickettsia are associates of blood-feeding arthropods that are pathogenic when transmitted to vertebrates. These species include the agents of acute human disease such as typhus and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. However, many other Rickettsia have been uncovered in recent surveys of bacteria associated with arthropods and other invertebrates; the hosts of these bacteria have no relationship with vertebrates. It is therefore perhaps more appropriate to consider Rickettsia as symbionts that are transmitted vertically in invertebrates, and secondarily as pathogens of vertebrates. In this review, we highlight the emerging diversity of Rickettsia species that are not associated with vertebrate pathogenicity. Phylogenetic analysis suggests multiple transitions between symbionts that are transmitted strictly vertically and those that exhibit mixed (horizontal and vertical) transmission. Rickettsia may thus be an excellent model system in which to study the evolution of transmission pathways. We also focus on the emergence of Rickettsia as a diverse reproductive manipulator of arthropods, similar to the closely related Wolbachia, including strains associated with male-killing, parthenogenesis, and effects on fertility. We emphasize some outstanding questions and potential research directions, and suggest ways in which the study of non-pathogenic Rickettsia can advance our understanding of their disease-causing relatives.},

	abstract = {Wing venation provides useful characters with which to classify extant and fossil insects. Recently, quantification of its shape using landmarks has increased the potential of wing venation to distinguish taxa. However, the use of wing landmarks in phylo-genetic analyses remains largely unexplored. Here, we tested landmark analysis under parsimony (LAUP) to include wing shape data in a phylogenetic analysis of hornets and yellow jackets. Using 68 morphological characters, nine genes and wing land-marks, we produced the first total-evidence phylogeny of Vespinae. We also tested the influence of LAUP parameters using sim-ulated landmarks. Our data confirmed that optimization parameters, alignment method, landmark number and, under low optimization parameters, the initial orientation of aligned shapes can influence LAUP results. Furthermore, single landmark configurations never accurately reflected the topology used for data simulation, but results were significantly close when com-pared to random topologies. Thus, wing landmark configurations were unreliable phylogenetic characters when treated indepen-dently, but provided some useful insights when combined with other data. Our phylogeny corroborated the monophyly of most groups proposed on the basis of morphology and showed the fossil Palaeovespa is distantly related to extant genera. Unstable relationships among genera suggest that rapid radiations occurred in the early history of the Vespinae.},

	abstract = {The area traversed by an animal during food gathering, mating, and other routine activities is termed the home range (HR), and its size is believed to reflect behavioral and physiological requirements (e.g., access to mates and food). We evaluated both bio- logical and methodological factors that may affect estimated HR sizes of lizards. We com- piled a database of nearly 500 published sex ? population data sets. These yielded usable data for 108 populations from 60 species, all with both sexes represented. Initial analyses indicated pervasive sex differences, so sexes were analyzed separately with both conven- tional and phylogenetically based statistical methods. First, we conducted conventional analyses of covariance, which treat each data point as statistically independent. Second, we repeated these analyses while comparing members of two major clades represented in our database, Iguania and Autarchoglossa. Third, we repeated the analyses after designating smaller clades, nested within major clades. Fourth, we performed a fully phylogenetic analysis via independent contrasts and a composite phylogeny assembled from published studies. All analyses showed highly significant effects of both biological (body size, diet, habitat type) and most methodological (calculation method and minimum number of sight- ings per individual, but not study duration) factors and covariates tested. The conventional analysis comparing Iguania and Autarchoglossa en toto indicated a significant difference, as has been suggested in the literature. The analysis with nested minor clades, however, revealed differences among these but not between the two major clades. The analysis with phylogenetically independent contrasts indicated no statistically significant differences ei- ther among minor clades or between major clades. We also used our database to compare the scaling of HR area to body mass, using recently published allometric equations for field metabolic rates of lizards. The similarity of allometric slopes suggests that, interspecifically, HR size scales directly with energetic requirements. Intraspecifically, however, we found that males in both Autarchoglossa and Iguania consistently had larger HRs than did females. This difference, presumably related to the need to maximize access to females, may impose a ``cost of reproduction'' on males},

Information about the circulation of tick-borne bacteria in ticks is lacking in Ecuador. Our aims were to investigate the tick species that parasitize Andean tapirs and cattle, and those present in the vegetation from the buffer zone of the Antisana Ecological Reserve and Cayambe-Coca National Park (Ecuador), and to investigate the presence of tick-borne bacteria.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Tick species were identified based on morphologic and genetic criteria. Detection of tick-borne bacteria belonging to Rickettsia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia and Borrelia genera was performed by PCRs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Our ticks included 91 Amblyomma multipunctum, 4 Amblyomma spp., 60 Rhipicephalus microplus, 5 Ixodes spp. and 1 Ixodes boliviensis. A potential Candidatus Rickettsia species closest to Rickettsia monacensis and Rickettsia tamurae (designated Rickettsia sp. 12G1) was detected in 3 R. microplus (3/57, 5.3{\%}). In addition, Anaplasma spp., assigned at least to Anaplasma phagocytophilum (or closely related genotypes) and Anaplasma marginale, were found in 2 A. multipunctum (2/87, 2.3{\%}) and 13 R. microplus (13/57, 22.8{\%}).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first description of Rickettsia sp. in ticks from Ecuador, and the analyses of sequences suggest the presence of a potential novel Rickettsia species.

We used random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers to determine the   distribution of genetic diversity within and among 10 German A. liliago   populations, ranging in size from 116 to over 2 million ramets. The   genetic diversity of an A. liliago population was highly positively   correlated with its population size. The overall differentiation among   populations (Phi-ST = 0.41, P {\textless} 0.0001, AMOVA) was considerably higher   than expected for a species with a mixed breeding system. No strong   correlation (P {\textless} 0.01) was detected between fitness parameters and   population size and genetic diversity. The reproductive output (seeds   per ramet) was only highly correlated (P {\textless} 0.001) with the proportion of   flowering ramets in a population which could be caused by a more   effective pollination in large populations which are more attractive to   specialized pollinators. The specialized A. liliago pollinator Merodon   rufus (Syrphidae) and high abundances of solitary bees could only be   found in A. liliago populations with more than 10,000 individuals.   Genetic differentiation among the investigated A. liliago populations   may have been caused by limited seed and pollen dispersal and a mixed   mating system permitting a high selfing rate. The differentiation among   the small and isolated populations lacking main pollinators seems to be   caused by genetic drift.},

Within species, plants in the north had higher nitrogen contents than in the south. There was a positive spatial covariation between habitat quality, local density and fawn body weight: animal densities and fawn body weights were highest in the north, the best habitat (i.e. the habitat with more abundant food of higher quality). These results differ from those recently obtained on red deer (Cervus elaphus).

These variations have several causes, involve temporal and spatial factors, and are not yet well understood. We use long-term data from 20 roe deer cohorts (1977-96) in a 2600 ha study area (Chiz{\'{e}}, western France) with two habitats contrasting in quality (rich oak forest in the North versus poor beech forest in the South) to analyse the effects of both cohort and habitat quality on adult mass (i.e. median body mass between 4 and 10 years of age) of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Cohort strongly influenced the adult body mass of roe deer in both sexes: males born in 1994 were 5.2 kg heavier when aged between 4 and 10 years old than males born in 1986, while females born in 1995 were 4.7 kg heavier between 4 and 10 years old than females born in 1982. For a given cohort, adult males were, on average, 0.9 kg heavier in the rich oak forest than in the poor beech forest. A similar trend occurred for adult females (0.5 kg heavier in the oak forest). The effects of cohort and habitat were additive and accounted for ca. 40{\%} of the variation observed in the adult mass of roe deer at Chiz{\'{e}} (males: 41.2{\%}; females: 40.2{\%}). Population density during the spring of the birth accounted for about 35{\%} of cohort variation, whereas rainfall in May-June had no effect. Such delayed effects of density at birth on adult body mass probably affect population dynamics, and might constitute a mechanism by which delayed density-dependence occurs in ungulate populations.},

Real-time PCR is easy to perform, provides the necessary accuracy and produces reliable as well as rapid quantification results. But accurate quantification of nucleic acids requires a reproducible methodology and an adequate mathematical model for data analysis. This study enters into the particular topics of the relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR of a target gene transcript in comparison to a reference gene transcript. Therefore, a new mathematical model is presented. The relative expression ratio is calculated only from the real-time PCR efficiencies and the crossing point deviation of an unknown sample versus a control. This model needs no calibration curve. Control levels were included in the model to standardise each reaction run with respect to RNA integrity, sample loading and inter-PCR variations. High accuracy and reproducibility ({\textless}2.5{\%} variation) were reached in LightCycler PCR using the established mathematical model.},

	abstract = {Zoonotic diseases are major causes of infection related morbidity and mortality worldwide. Of the various arthropods capable of transmitting pathogens that cause such diseases to humans, ticks, which are vectors of more kinds of pathogens than any other group of invertebrate, have become an increasing focus of attention. This is particularly the case in the temperate northern hemisphere where they are a significant vector of human disease. Here, we provide an overview of the complex ecological systems defining the various epidemiological cycles of tick-borne diseases. We highlight the abiotic and biotic factors influencing the establishment and persistence of tick populations and their associated pathogens. Furthermore, we emphasize the dynamic nature of such systems, especially when they are under the influence of both small and large-scale anthropogenic changes to the environment. Although a great deal of work has been done on ticks and the diseases which they transmit, the very dynamism of the system means that new factors are continually arising which shift the epidemiological pattern within specific areas. We therefore consider that more detailed, long-term (i.e. at least 10. years), multidisciplinary studies need to be carried out to define why and how these pattern shifts take place and to determine their public health significance. {\textcopyright} 2013 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.},

	abstract = {The adder, Vipera berus, has the widest distribution of any terrestrial snake and has been stated as being the commonest snake in Britain (SMITH 1973) although it is more recently described as having a patchy distribution in England, Scotland, and Wales, and is most abundant in southern England (BEEBEE {\&} GRIFFITHS 2000). A long term study of V. berus, spanning thirty years, was undertaken in south east Dorset, England, of a number of populations for which the results of two are presented here. The duration of the study has allowed detailed recording of the general population and subpopulations, resulting in the known life histories for a number of individual snakes. The wider emphasis has been on the structure and life cycles of subpopulations in relation to the general population embracing the aspects of reproduction, hierarchy, longevity, seasonal movement, site fidelity, and population stability. Although important data with regard to reproduction was obtained (PHELPS, in prep) only that which was pertinent to social behaviour is included here. Results are compared with those from other parts of the adder's range and the implications for appropriate conservation measures are discussed.},

	abstract = {Phylogeographic analyses of the fauna of the Australian wet tropics rainforest have provided strong evidence for long-term isolation of populations among allopatric refugia, yet typically there is no corresponding divergence in morphology. This system provides an opportunity to examine the consequences of geographic isolation, independent of morphological divergence, and thus to assess the broader significance of historical subdivisions revealed through mitochondrial DNA phylogeography. We have located and characterized a zone of secondary contact between two long isolated (mtDNA divergence {\textgreater} 15{\%}) lineages of the skink Carlia rubrigularis using one mitochondrial and eight nuclear (two intron, six microsatellite) markers. This revealed a remarkably narrow (width {\textless} 3 km) hybrid zone with substantial linkage disequilibrium and strong deficits of heterozygotes at two of three nuclear loci with diagnostic alleles. Cline centers were coincident across loci. Using a novel form of likelihood analysis, we were unable to distinguish between sigmoidal and stepped cline shapes except at one nuclear locus for which the latter was inferred. Given estimated dispersal rates of 90-133 m x gen(-1/2) and assuming equilibrium, the observed cline widths suggest effective selection against heterozygotes of at least 22-49{\%} and possibly as high as 70{\%}. These observations reveal substantial postmating isolation, although the absence of consistent deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at diagnostic loci suggests that there is little accompanying premating isolation. The tight geographic correspondence between transitions in mtDNA and those for nuclear genes and corresponding evidence for selection against hybrids indicates that these morphologically cryptic phylogroups could be considered as incipient species. Nonetheless, we caution against the use of mtDNA phylogeography as a sole criterion for defining species boundaries.},

In two to these four replicates, a significant, positive association between protein heterozygosity and size was observed.

@article{Pilakouta2016,
	abstract = {Inbreeding results from matings between relatives and can cause a reduction in offspring fitness, known as inbreeding depression. Previous work has shown that a wide range of environmental stresses, such as extreme temperatures, starvation, and parasitism, can exacerbate inbreeding depression. It has recently been argued that stresses due to intraspecific competition should have a stronger effect on the severity of inbreeding depression than stresses due to harsh physical conditions. Here, we tested whether an increase in the intensity of sibling competition can exacerbate inbreeding depression in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. We used a 2×3 factorial design with offspring inbreeding status (outbred or inbred) and brood size (5, 20, or 40 larvae) as the two factors. We found a main effect of inbreeding status, as inbred larvae had lower survival than outbred larvae, and a main effect of brood size, as larvae in large broods had lower survival and mass than larvae in medium-sized broods. However, there was no effect of the interaction between inbreeding status and brood size, suggesting that sibling competition did not influence the severity of inbreeding depression. Since we focused on sibling competition within homogeneous broods of either inbred or outbred larvae, we cannot rule out possible effects of sibling competition on inbreeding depression in mixed paternity broods comprising of both inbred and outbred offspring. More information on whether and when sibling competition might influence the expression of inbreeding depression can help advance our understanding of the causes underlying variation in the severity of inbreeding depression.

However, the underlying genetic mechanisms causing environmental fluctuations in inbreeding depression, and the consequences of this variation for the evolution of self-fertilization, have been little studied. Here, we consider temporal fluctuations of the selection coefficient in an explicit genetic model of inbreeding depression. We show that substantial variance in inbreeding depression can be generated at equilibrium by fluctuating selection, although the simulated variance tends to be lower than has been measured in experimental studies. Our simulations also reveal that purging of deleterious mutations does not depend on the variance in their selection coefficient. Finally, an evolutionary analysis shows that, in contrast to previous theoretical approaches, intermediate selfing rates are never evolutionarily stable when the variation in inbreeding depression is due to fluctuations in the selection coefficient on deleterious mutations.},

	abstract = {Comparative ecology uses interspecific relationships among traits, while accounting for the phylogenetic non-independence of species, to uncover general evolutionary processes. Applied to biogeographic questions, it can be a powerful tool to explain the spatial distribution of organisms. Here, we review how comparative methods can elucidate biogeographic patterns and processes, using analyses of distributional data on parasites (fleas and helminths) as case studies. Methods exist to detect phylogenetic signals, i.e. the degree of phylogenetic dependence of a given character, and either to control for these signals in statistical analyses of interspecific data, or to measure their contribution to variance. Parasite-host interactions present a special case, as a given trait may be a parasite trait, a host trait or a property of the coevolved association rather than of one participant only. For some analyses, it is therefore necessary to correct simultaneously for both parasite phylogeny and host phylogeny, or to evaluate which has the greatest influence on trait expression. Using comparative approaches, we show that two fundamental properties of parasites, their niche breadth, i.e. host specificity, and the nature of their life cycle, can explain interspecific and latitudinal variation in the sizes of their geographical ranges, or rates of distance decay in the similarity of parasite communities. These findings illustrate the ways in which phylogenetically based comparative methods can contribute to biogeographic research.},

	abstract = {Identity by descent (IBD) is a fundamental concept in genetics and refers to alleles that are descended from a common ancestor in a base population. Identity by state (IBS) simply refers to alleles that are the same, irrespective of whether they are inherited from a recent ancestor. In modern applications, IBD relationships are estimated from genetic markers in individuals without any known relationship. This can lead to erroneous inference because a consistent base population is not used. We argue that the purpose of most IBD calculations is to predict IBS at unobserved loci. Recognizing this aim leads to better methods to estimating IBD with benefits in mapping genes, estimating genetic variance and predicting inbreeding depression.},

	abstract = {The Dominican Republic faces multiple threats to biodiversity. A list of native species of amphibians and reptiles (excluding sea turtles) is presented. Some may have become extinct recently, substantial populations of others have been extirpated, some have greatly reduced numbers, and others appear to be rare or have restricted ranges. Most of the 13 taxa listed are relatively large, vulnerable to human exploitation or introduced predators, and/or have limited distributions and specific habitat requirements. To be listed, evidence must exist that: (1) populations are dwindling, (2) the range is shrinking, or (3) a species must be vulnerable to exploitation and historically rare. Two iguanas (Cyclura cornuta, C. ricordii), two turtles (Trachemys decorata, T. stejnegeri vicina), and one crocodilian (Crocodylus acutus) have been exploited extensively and have long been recognized as threatened or endangered. The ranges of Cyclura ricordii and T. decorata are very localized and the previously widespread ranges of the others have shrunk or become fragmented. A toad (Bufo fluviaticus), a large galliwasp (Celestus anelpistus), and a snake (Alsophis melanichnus) have not been collected recently. Only a few specimens of another galliwasp (C. carraui) and a dwarf gecko (Sphaerodactylus cochranae) have been taken recently. In addition, extensive portions of the habitats of these species have been severely altered. Three other snakes (Alsophis anomalus, Ialtris agyrtes, I. dorsalis) are rare and may never have been common. Their size and habits render them vulnerable to predation by the introduced mongoose and to decimation by humans who fear and dislike them.},

In this prospective study, nested PCR was performed on skin biopsy specimens to confirm the diagnosis of spotted fever.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In 58 clinically suspected cases of spotted fever, nested PCR, to detect gltA, 17 kDa lipoprotein antigen gene (17 kDa), ompA and ompB, from skin biopsy of the rash was performed. Sequencing was carried on amplicons representing the four targets to confirm specificity of amplification. This was followed by phylogenetic analysis using MEGA version 4.0 software.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The gltA, 17 kDa, ompA, and ompB genes were detected from skin biopsy specimens in 38, 23, 27, and 22 individuals. Sequence analysis revealed that the gltA, 17 kDa, ompA, and ompB sequences belonged to spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsia. Of the six partial ompA gene sequences, only one was dissimilar to the previously reported 'Candidatus Rickettsia kellyi'.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Further evidence indicates that SFG rickettsiae resembling 'Candidatus Rickettsia kellyi' cause fever and rash in southern India. More detailed phylogenetic analysis following isolation of rickettsia in culture is required for providing irrefutable proof for the occurrence of novel spotted fever rickettsiae in this region.},

	abstract = {Inbreeding depression is environmentally dependent, such that a population may suffer from inbreeding depression in one environment but not another. We examined the phenotypic responses of 35 inbred (F = 0.672) lineages of the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum in two different climatic environments. We found a significant environmental effect on males but not females. More important, we found that the rank fitness order of lineages differs between environments; lineages of high fitness in one environment may have low fitness in another environment. This change in rank is evident in a significant genotype-by-environment interaction for inbreeding depression for both females and males. These results suggest that even if we know the average environmental effect of inbreeding depression in a population, for any particular lineage measurements of inbreeding depression in one environment may not predict the level of inbreeding depression in another environment. Conservation biologists need to be aware of the environmental dependency of inbreeding depression when planning wildlife refuges or captive propagation programs for small populations. Ideally, captive propagation programs should maintain separate lineages for release efforts. Refuge design programs should consider maintaining a range of habitat types.},

	abstract = {An important issue for designing any conservation programme aimed at preserving genetic diversity is estimation of the scale at which genetic structuring occurs. Additional relevant factors include distinguishing whether or not population structuring is expected to be stable as predicted by the member-vagrant hypothesis, or alternatively, whether populations are more prone to local extinction-recolonization processes, as predicted by the metapopulation evolutionary model. In this study, the population genetic structure of Atlantic salmon from 11 locations within or nearby the Varzuga River tributary system was assessed using 17 microsatellites. Mantel tests and spatial autocorrelation analyses revealed a significant isolation-by-distance signal within the tributary system as well as a negative association between the level of genetic diversity and waterway distance from the river mouth, indicating that dispersal is less likely to occur to populations deep in the tributary system. Individual-level spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated that the majority of migration occurred between populations situated within 20 km of each other. The relatively high level of genetic structuring and significant isolation-by-distance signal observed in the Varzuga tributaries are concordant with the predictions of the member-vagrant evolutionary model. However, one subpopulation in particular revealed signs of instability which may be due to its location in the tidal zone, or due to the fact that it is more affected by human impacts. The results suggest that preservation of a number of spawning sites spaced throughout the tributary system is recommendable for ensuring sustainable fishing tourism in the river.},

	abstract = {The glacial episodes of the Quaternary (2.6 million years ago-present) were a major factor in shaping the present-day distributions of extant flora and fauna, with expansions and contractions of the ice sheets rendering large areas uninhabitable for most species. Fossil records suggest that many species survived glacial maxima by retreating to refugia, usually at lower latitudes. Recently, phylogeographic studies have given support to the existence of previously unknown, or cryptic, refugia. Here we summarise many of these insights into the glacial histories of species in cryptic refugia gained through phylogeographic approaches. Understanding such refugia might be important as the Earth heads into another period of climate change, in terms of predicting the effects on species distribution and survival. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {To empirically determine the effects of sample size on commonly used measures of average genetic diversity, we genotyped 200 song sparrows Melospiza melodia from two populations, one genetically depauperate (n 100) and the other genetically diverse (n 100), using eight microsatellite loci. These genotypes were used to randomly create 10,000 datasets of differing sizes (5 to 50) for each population to determine what the effects of sample size might be on several estimates of genetic diversity (number of alleles per locus, average observed heterozygosity, and unbiased average expected heterozygosity) in natural populations of conservation concern. We found that at small sample sizes of 5 to 10 individuals, estimates of unbiased heterozygosity outperformed those based on observed heterozygosity or allelic diversity for both low- and high-diversity populations. We also found that when comparing across populations in which different numbers of individuals were sampled, rarefaction provided a useful way to compare estimates of allelic diversity. We recommend that standard errors should be reported for all diversity estimators, especially when sample sizes are small. We also recommend that at least 20 to 30 individuals be sampled in microsatellite studies that assess genetic diversity when working in a population that has an unknown level of diversity. However, research on critically endangered populations (where large sample sizes are impossible or extremely difficult to obtain) should include measures of genetic diversity even if sample sizes are less than ideal. These estimates can be useful in assessing the genetic diversity of the population.},

Indirect estimates of effective population size may be made from genetic data such as temporal variation of allelic frequencies or linkage disequilibrium in cohorts. We suggest here that an indirect estimate of the effective number of breeders might be based on the excess of heterozygosity expected in a cohort of progeny produced by a limited number of males and females. In computer simulations, heterozygote excesses for 30 unlinked loci having various numbers of alleles and allele-frequency profiles were obtained for cohorts produced by samples of breeders drawn form an age-structured population and having known variance in reproductive success and effective number. The 95{\%} confidence limits around the estimate contained the true effective population size in 70 of 72 trials and the Spearman rank correlation of estimated and actual values was 0.991. An estimate based on the heterozygote excess might have certain advantages over the previous estimates, requiring only single-locus and single-cohort data, but the sampling error among individuals and the effect of departures from random union of gametes still need to be explored.},

	abstract = {Abstract  The effective number of breeders (N b) for a cohort of progeny can be estimated from an excess of heterozygotes that arises in progeny produced by finite numbers of parents. In principle, N b is a simple function of the standardized deviation (D) of the proportion of heterozygous progeny from its expectation under random mating. We explored the sampling properties of this D-estimator of N b through computer simulation. The accuracy of the D-estimator is remarkably robust to variation in numbers of alleles and loci and the presence of rare alleles, though precision can be low if, relative to a given N b, the sample of progeny or the cumulative number of independent alleles (n ci) sampled is too small. For N b up to 30 parents, acceptable accuracy is achieved with sample sizes of 200 or more progeny and 80 or more independent alleles; for N b of 50--100, a sample of 500--1,000 progeny and 450--900 independent alleles are required for similar accuracy and precision. Though the estimator is most applicable for the situation of random union of gametes (as may occur in some marine invertebrates or fish, for example), it works for other mating systems (monogamous or polygamous pairings, polygyny), when the effective number of breeders is small (N b ≤ 20). Simulations reveal small overestimation biases with smaller sample sizes, rare alleles, or highly polymorphic loci (≥10 alleles). Despite this bias, multiallelic loci are preferable to many loci with few alleles, which have larger sampling errors.},

	abstract = {Inferences of population structure and more precisely the identification of genetically homogeneous groups of indi- viduals are essential to the fields of ecology, evolutionary biology and conservation biology. Such population struc- ture inferences are routinely investigated via the program STRUCTURE implementing a Bayesian algorithm to identify groups of individuals at Hardy--Weinberg and linkage equilibrium. While the method is performing relatively well under various population models with even sampling between subpopulations, the robustness of the method to uneven sample size between subpopulations and/or hierarchical levels of population structure has not yet been tested despite being commonly encountered in empirical data sets. In this study, I used simulated and empirical microsatellite data sets to investigate the impact of uneven sample size between subpopulations and/or hierarchical levels of population structure on the detected population structure. The results demonstrated that uneven sampling often leads to wrong inferences on hierarchical structure and downward-biased estimates of the true number of sub- populations. Distinct subpopulations with reduced sampling tended to be merged together, while at the same time, individuals from extensively sampled subpopulations were generally split, despite belonging to the same panmictic population. Four new supervised methods to detect the number of clusters were developed and tested as part of this study and were found to outperform the existing methods using both evenly and unevenly sampled data sets. Addi- tionally, a subsampling strategy aiming to reduce sampling unevenness between subpopulations is presented and tested. These results altogether demonstrate that when sampling evenness is accounted for, the detection of the correct population structure is greatly improved.},

We combined demography and molecular genetics to study how intraspecific competition affects microevolution in cohorts of volunteer plants of cassava (Manihot esculenta) originating from seeds in slash-and-burn fields of Palikur Amerindians in French Guiana. In this clonally propagated crop, genotypic diversity is enhanced by the incorporation of volunteer plants into farmers' stocks of clonal propagules. Mortality of volunteer plants was density-dependent. Furthermore, the size asymmetry of intraspecific competition increased with local clustering of plants. Size of plants was correlated with their multilocus heterozygosity, and stronger size-dependence of survival in clusters of plants, compared with solitary plants, increased the magnitude of inbreeding depression when competition was severe. The density-dependence of inbreeding depression of volunteer plants helps explain the high heterozygosity of volunteers that survive to harvest time and thus become candidates for clonal propagation. This effect could help favour the maintenance of sex in this 'vegetatively' propagated crop plant.},

Many pond-breeding amphibians are presumed to exist as metapopulations, but few studies demonstrate the extent and consequences of this metapopulation structure. Gene flow measures may facilitate the construction of more realistic models of population structure than direct measures of migration. This is especially true for species that are cryptic, such as many amphibians. We used eight polymorphic microsatellite loci to determine the genetic population structure of spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) breeding at 17 ponds in northeastern Ohio, a landscape fragmented by roads, agriculture, urban areas and the Cuyahoga River. Using a variety of analyses (Bayesian clustering, F-statistics, AMOVA) we generated a model of salamander population genetic structure. Our data revealed patterns of genetic connectivity that were not predicted by geographical distances between ponds (no isolation by distance). We also tested for a relationship between population structure and several indices of landscape resistance, but found no effect of potential barriers to dispersal on genetic connectivity. Strong overall connectivity among ponds, despite the hostile habitat matrix, may be facilitated by a network of riparian corridors associated with the Cuyahoga River; however, high gene flow in this system may indicate a general ability to disperse and colonize beyond particular corridors.},

	abstract = {Rice is among the 3 most important crops worldwide. While much of the world's rice harvest is based on modern high-yield varieties, traditional varieties of rice grown by indigenous groups have great importance as a resource for future crop improvement. These local landraces represent an intermediate stage of domestication between a wild ancestor and modern varieties and they serve as reservoirs of genetic variation. Such genetic variation is influenced both by natural processes such as selection and drift, and by the agriculture practices of local farmers. How these processes interact to shape and change the population genetics of landrace rice is unknown. Here, we determine the population genetic structure of a single variety of landrace rice, Bue Chomee, cultivated by Karen people of Thailand. Microsatellite markers reveal high level of genetic variation despite predominant inbreeding in the crop. Bue Chomee rice shows slight but significant genetic differentiation among Karen villages. Moreover, genetically determined traits such as flowering time can vary significantly among villages. An unanticipated result was the overall pattern of genetic differentiation across villages which conforms to an isolation by distance model of differentiation. Isolation by distance is observed in natural plant species where the likelihood of gene flow is inversely related to distance. In Karen rice, gene flow is the result of farmers' seed sharing networks. Taken together, these data suggest that landrace rice is a dynamic genetic system that responds to evolutionary forces, both natural and those imposed by humans.},

Such an estimate is invaluable for comparative evolutionary studies, and to address their classification. Here, we present the first large-scale phylogenetic estimate for Squamata. Results: The estimated phylogeny contains 4161 species, representing all currently recognized families and subfamilies. The analysis is based on up to 12896 base pairs of sequence data per species (average = 2497 bp) from 12 genes, including seven nuclear loci (BDNF, c-mos, NT3, PDC, R35, RAG-1, and RAG-2), and five mitochondrial genes (12S, 16S, cytochrome b, ND2, and ND4). The tree provides important confirmation for recent estimates of higher-level squamate phylogeny based on molecular data (but with more limited taxon sampling), estimates that are very different from previous morphology-based hypotheses. The tree also includes many relationships that differ from previous molecular estimates and many that differ from traditional taxonomy. Conclusions: We present a new large-scale phylogeny of squamate reptiles that should be a valuable resource for future comparative studies. We also present a revised classification of squamates at the family and subfamily level to bring the taxonomy more in line with the new phylogenetic hypothesis. This classification includes new, resurrected, and modified subfamilies within gymnophthalmid and scincid lizards, and boid, colubrid, and lamprophiid snakes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Pyron et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Since this information refers strictly to El Ni{\~{n}}o occurrences, a regional manifestation of the large-scale (El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)) event, it is based primarily on evidence obtained from the west coast region of northern South America and its adjacent Pacific Ocean waters. Authored lists of events were not acceptable without referenced valid information sources. It was desirable to have cross-correlated reports from independent sources. Relative strengths of events are based on such considerations as wind and current effects on travel times of ancient sailing ships, degree of physical damage and destruction, amounts of rainfall and flooding, mass mortality of endemic marine organisms and guano birds, extent of invasion by tropical nekton, rises in sea temperatures and sea levels, affects on coastal fisheries and fish meal production, etc. Emphasis is placed on strong and very strong events. For example, the 1940-1941, 1957-1958, and 1972-1973 events fall into the strong category, whereas the 1891, 1925-1926 and 1982-1983 events are considered very strong. Over our period of study, 47 El Ni{\~{n}}o events were placed in the strong or very strong categories. Over the period 1800-present, we noted 32 El Ni{\~{n}}o events of moderate or near moderate intensity. Weak events are not included here. The approach used here caused us to revise many of our earlier evaluations concerning event occurrences and intensities. Our tropical Pacific thickness analyses and cumulative plots of Southern Oscillation index anomalies over the southeast Pacific trade wind zone showed additional evidence as to the unusual strength of the 1982-1983 event. Also, in our investigation we noted several periods of long-Term (near decadal or longer) climatic change.},

	abstract = {The amount and nature of genetic variation available to natural selection affect the rate, course and outcome of evolution. Consequently, the study of the genetic basis of adaptive evolutionary change has occupied biologists for decades, but progress has been hampered by the lack of resolution and the absence of a genome-level perspective. Technological advances in recent years should now allow us to answer many long-standing questions about the nature of adaptation. The data gathered so far are beginning to challenge some widespread views of the way in which natural selection operates at the genomic level. Papers in this Special Feature of Proceedings of the Royal Society B illustrate various aspects of the broad field of adaptation genomics. This introductory article sets up a context and, on the basis of a few selected examples, discusses how genomic data can advance our understanding of the process of adaptation.},

	abstract = {In wild populations negative effects from inbreeding are usually difficult to assess. The contemporary Scandinavian wolf population (Canis lupus) was established in 1983. With only three founders this population, with approximately 100 individuals, exhibits lower genetic variability than the neighbouring eastern population. Congenital malformations of the backbone were found in this highly inbred population. This study assesses the frequency and morphology of vertebral malformations within the Scandinavian wolf population and compares this with two reference populations. We discuss the etiology of malformations, how they may affect individuals and viability for the population. The frequencies of lumbosacral transitional vertebrae were higher in the small contemporary population than in the eastern reference population. Certain other defects were not found in the reference populations. This study demonstrates malformations that may have a negative impact on the Scandinavian wolf population and be an indication of inbreeding depression. For the conservation of this endangered population, we assert that immigration of wolves from eastern populations is essential. {\textcopyright} 2006 Deutsche Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r S{\"{a}}ugetierkunde.

	abstract = {The genetic aspects of population health are critical, but frequently difficult to assess. Of concern has been the genetic constitution of Scandinavian wolves (Canis lupus), which represent an important case in conservation. We examined the incidence of different congenital anomalies for 171 Scandinavian wolves, including the immigrant founder female, born during a 32-year period between 1978 and 2010. The incidence of anomalies rose from 13{\%} to 40{\%} throughout the 32-year study period. Our ability to detect this increase was likely facilitated by having considered multiple kinds of anomaly. Many of the found anomalies are likely associated with inbreeding or some form of genetic deterioration. These observations have implications for understanding the conservation needs of Scandinavian wolves. Moreover, these observations and the history of managing Scandinavian wolves focus attention on a broader question, whether conservation is merely about avoiding extinction of remnant populations, or whether conservation also entails maintaining genetic aspects of population health.},

The program STRUCTURE is commonly used to infer population structure using multi-locus genotype data. However, a tool with graphical-user interface is currently not available to visualize STRUCTURE bar plots.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We introduce STRUCTURE PLOT, a program for drawing STRUCTURE bar plots. The program generates publication ready, aesthetic STRUCTURE bar plots by using individual Q matrix from STRUCTURE or CLUMPP output. The program is very simple to use and includes variety of options like sorting bar by original order or by K, and selection of colors from R colors or RColorBrewer palette. Individual or population labels can be printed below or above the plot in any angle. Size of the graph and label can be defined, and option is provided to save plot in variety of picture formats in user defined resolution.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The program is implemented as a web application for online users and also as a standalone shiny application. Web application is compatible to majority of leading web browsers and standalone version can be launched using a simple R command.

	abstract = {Several tests have been proposed to detect departures of nucleotide variability patterns from neutral expectations. However, very different kinds of evolutionary processes, such as selective events or demographic changes, can produce similar deviations from these tests, thus making interpretation difficult when a significant departure of neutrality is detected. Here we study the effects of demography and recombination upon neutrality tests by analyzing their power under sudden population expansions, sudden contractions, and bottlenecks. We evaluate tests based on the frequency spectrum of mutations and the distribution of haplotypes and explore the consequences of using incorrect estimates of the rates of recombination when testing for neutrality. We show that tests that rely on haplotype frequencies-especially Fs and ZnS, which are based, respectively, on the number of different haplotypes and on the r2 values between all pairs of polymorphic sites-are the most powerful for detecting expansions on nonrecombining genomic regions. Nevertheless, they are strongly affected by misestimations of recombination, so they should not be used when recombination levels are unknown. Instead, class I tests, particularly Tajima's D or R2, are recommended.},

The method is illustrated by analyzing RFLP genotypes in samples of humans from Australian, Japanese, New Guinean, and Senegalese populations.

	abstract = {Animals often cope with adverse events by releasing glucocorticoid hormones, which in turn promote increased energy assimilation. In captive animals, crowding also leads to increased glucocorticoid activity, probably because of increased levels of social competition. We investigated how group size and ectoparasite infestations affected endogenous levels of the glucocorticoid hormone, corticosterone, in colonial cliff swallows, Petrochelidon pyrrhonota, in southwestern Nebraska, U.S.A. Parasites were removed from some colonies by fumigating nests. Baseline levels of corticosterone in breeding adults varied significantly with whether parasites were present, colony size (measured by total number of active nests at a site) and nesting stage. Across all analyses, birds from fumigated colonies averaged significantly lower baseline levels of corticosterone. These levels in adults increased with colony size at nonfumigated sites, especially during the period when nestlings were being fed, but no relation or the opposite one was found for birds in fumigated colonies. Baseline corticosterone levels were unrelated to sex, age, body weight or testosterone levels in adults. Corticosterone concentrations tended to increase during a bad-weather event when food was scarce. Patterns in nestling and recently fledged juveniles were consistent with those in adults. The increased baseline levels of corticosterone in birds of larger colonies appear related to the larger number of parasites there. Higher levels of corticosterone probably facilitate increased allocation of time and energy to foraging and greater energy assimilation during challenging events such as bad weather, parasitism by blood-feeding bugs in large colonies and the period when young are becoming independent of their parents. {\textcopyright} 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

@article{Rassmann1997,
	abstract = {Marine iguanas may have inhabited the Gal{\'{a}}pagos archipelago and its former, now sunken islands for more than 10 million years (Myr). It is therefore surprising that morphological and immunological data indicate little evolutionary divergence within the genus. We utilized mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence analyses and nuclear DNA fingerprinting to re-evaluate the level and pattern of genetic differentiation among 22 marine iguana populations from throughout the archipelago. Both genetic marker systems detect a low level of within-genus divergence, but they show contrasting levels of geographical subdivision among the populations. The mitochondrial gene pools of populations from different regions of the archipelago are isolated, and the mtDNA pattern appears to follow the sequence in which the islands were colonized by marine iguanas. Conversely, the nuclear DNA study indicates substantial interpopulational gene exchange, and the geographical distribution of the nuclear markers seems to be determined by isolation by distance among the populations. The natural history of marine iguanas suggests that the contrasting nuclear and mitochondrial DNA patterns result from an asymmetric migration behaviour of the two sexes, with higher (active and passive) interisland dispersal for males than females. Separate genetic analyses for the sexes appear to support this hypophesis. Based on these findings, a scenario is proposed that explains the marine iguanas' low genetic divergence, notwithstanding their long evolutionary history in the Gal{\'{a}}pagos archipelago.},

	abstract = {The gecko Tarentola mauritanica is a Mediterranean species that is widely distributed across southern Europe and North Africa. Initial phylogeographic studies based on mtDNA concluded that the European populations originated from recent colonizations from North Africa, possibly involving man-mediated introductions. A distinct lineage, found to be a sister taxon to the widespread European lineage, was subsequently reported from parts of the Iberian Peninsula. Like many gecko species, T. mauritanica contains several deep intraspecific genetic lineages within North Africa. However, in contrast to this diversity, a single mtDNA haplotype is widespread across a large part of its European range. In this work, we analysed a total of 834 base pairs from two mtDNA genes (12SrRNA and 16SrRNA) for 154 specimens, and a total of 1876. bp from three nuclear genes (ACM4, MC1R and Rag2) for 51 specimens to test the phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns proposed for T. mauritanica based on mtDNA sequences. The mtDNA results reveal a Moroccan lineage basal to the common " European" haplotype, thus suggesting that the latter probably originated in Morocco. The remaining lineages obtained are the same as those observed in previous studies. In contrast, the nDNA data do not support the majority of the mtDNA phylogenetic relationships, possibly due to incomplete lineage sorting of these markers. Moreover, the mtDNA data suggest that the Iberian clade seems to have undergone a population expansion. Surprisingly, the European clade presents a higher nucleotide diversity for the nuclear genes when compared to the combined mtDNA dataset. These analyses suggest that the low mtDNA variability that characterises the European populations of T. mauritanica is the result of a selective sweep process and not solely due to a recent colonization event. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Satellite telemetry data are a key source of animal distribution information for marine ecosystem management and conservation activities. We used two decades of telemetry data from the East Antarctic sector of the Southern Ocean. Habitat utilization models for the spring/summer period were developed for six highly abundant, wide-ranging meso- and top-predator species: Ad{\'{e}}lie Pygoscelis adeliae and emperor Aptenodytes forsteri penguins, light-mantled albatross Phoebetria palpebrata, Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella, southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina, and Weddell seals Leptonychotes weddellii. The regional predictions from these models were combined to identify areas utilized by multiple species, and therefore likely to be of particular ecological significance. These areas were distributed across the longitudinal breadth of the East Antarctic sector, and were characterized by proximity to breeding colonies, both on the Antarctic continent and on subantarctic islands to the north, and by sea-ice dynamics, particularly locations of winter polynyas. These areas of important habitat were also congruent with many of the areas reported to be showing the strongest regional trends in sea ice seasonality. The results emphasize the importance of on-shore and sea-ice processes to Antarctic marine ecosystems. Our study provides ocean-basin-scale predictions of predator habitat utilization, an assessment of contemporary habitat use against which future changes can be assessed, and is of direct relevance to current conservation planning and spatial management efforts.},

	abstract = {The ability of populations to undergo adaptive evolution depends on the presence of quantitative genetic variation for ecologically important traits. Although molecular measures are widely used as surrogates for quantitative genetic variation, there is controversy about the strength of the relationship between the two. To resolve this issue, we carried out a meta-analysis based on 71 datasets. The mean correlation between molecular and quantitative measures of genetic variation was weak (r = 0.217). Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between the two measures for life-history traits (r = -0.11) or for the quantitative measure generally considered as the best indicator of adaptive potential, heritability (r = -0.08). Consequently, molecular measures of genetic diversity have only a very limited ability to predict quantitative genetic variability. When information about a population's short-term evolutionary potential or estimates of local adaptation and population divergence are required, quantitative genetic variation should be measured directly.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Genetic diversity is one of the three forms of biodiversity recognized by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as deserving conservation. The need to conserve genetic diversity within populations is based on two arguments: the necessity of genetic diversity for evolution to occur, and the expected relationship between heterozygosity and population fitness. Because loss of genetic diversity is related to inbreeding, and inbreeding reduces reproductive fitness, a correlation is expected between heterozygosity and population fitness. Long-term effective population size, which determines rates of inbreeding, should also be correlated with fitness. However, other theoretical considerations and empirical observations suggest that the correlation between fitness and heterozygosity may be weak or nonexistent. We used all the data sets we could locate (34 ) to perform a meta-analysis and resolve the issue. Data sets were included in the study, provided that fitness, or a component of fitness, was measured for three or more populations along with heterozygosity, heritability, and/or population size. The mean weighted correlation between measures of genetic diversity, at the population level, and population fitness was 0.4323. The correlation was highly significant and explained 19{\%} of the variation in fitness. Our study strengthens concerns that the loss of heterozygosity has a deleterious effect on population fitness and supports the IUCN designation of genetic diversity as worthy of conservation. Resumen: La diversidad gen{\'{e}}tica es una de las tres formas de biodiversidad reconocidas por la Uni{\'{o}}n de Conservaci{\'{o}}n Mundial ( IUCN ) que merecen ser conservadas. La necesidad de conservar la diversidad gen{\'{e}}tica de las poblaciones se basa en dos argumentos: la necesidad de diversidad gen{\'{e}}tica para que ocurra la evoluci{\'{o}}n, y la relaci{\'{o}}n esperada entre la heterocigosidad y la adaptabilidad de la poblaci{\'{o}}n. Debido a que la p{\'{e}}rdida de diversidad gen{\'{e}}tica se relaciona con la endogamia, y la endogamia reduce la aptitud reproductiva, se espera una correlaci{\'{o}}n entre heterocigosidad y adaptabilidad de la poblaci{\'{o}}n.

The morphology of the lubricatory system of the vomeronasal organ (the source of this fluid) varies among classes, being either intrinsic (mammalian and caecilian amphibian vomeronasal glands) or extrinsic (anuran and urodele nasal glands). In the few squamate reptiles thus far examined, there are no submucosal vomeronasal glands. In this study, we examined the vomeronasal organs of several species of Australian squamates using histological, histochemical and ultrastructural techniques, with the goal of determining the morphology of the lubricatory system in the vomeronasal organ. Histochemically, the fluid within the vomeronasal organ of all squamates is mucoserous, though it is uncertain whether mucous and serous constituents constitute separate components. The vomeronasal organ produces few secretory granules intrinsically, implying an extrinsic source for the luminal fluid. Of three possible candidates, the Harderian gland is the most likely extrinsic source of this secretion.},

Little is known about Turks Island Boas (Epicrates chrysogaster chrysogaster), a subspecies of the Southern Bahamas Boa endemic to the Turks and Caicos Islands, and no published ecological studies exist for this subspecies. A long history of human habitation, greatly exacerbated by exponentially increasing development in the last several decades, appears to be threatening the remaining populations of these boas. However, a lack of basic ecological information is holding back conservation efforts. Here we report on the first multiyear ecological study of Turks Island Boas, focusing on an important population located on the small island of Big Ambergris Cay in the southeastern margin of the Caicos Bank. Encounter rates of up to 3.5 snakes per person-hour make this population especially easy to study. We captured 249 snakes, 11 of which were recaptures. We provide basic natural history information including size, color pattern, girth, body temperature, abundance, diet, activity, diurnal refuge selection, and population size. We also clarify the known distribution and discuss the conservation concerns of this species. This study fills a gap in our ecological knowledge of Bahamian boas and will provide important baseline data for the Big Ambergris Cay population of Turks Island Boas as this small island undergoes extensive development over the next several decades.},

	abstract = {The Turks Island Boa (Epicrates c. chrysogaster) is endemic to the Turks and Caicos Islands and is currently known from only 11 islands. The subspecies has likely been extirpated from several islands in its historic range, and all remaining populations are threatened with extirpation owing to habitat loss, introduced feral predators, malicious killing, and vehicle strikes. To assist conservation efforts, we undertook a genetic analysis of 53 individual E. c. chrysogaster, representing five island populations, with the goal of identifying existing population structure and genetic diversity. For each snake sampled, we sequenced one mitochondrial and two nuclear genes, resulting in 1591 bp of sequence, and screened nine microsatellite loci. All individuals were found to be monomorphic at the four microsatellite loci that amplified, and only three individuals were found to vary (by a single nucleotide polymorphism) in either nuclear gene. Nine mitochondrial haplotypes were found, with a maximum sequence divergence of ,1{\%}. Taken together, these data indicate shallow genetic divergence in this subspecies, possibly owing to a lack of historical population structure and small population size when the Turks and Caicos Banks were each single islands during the last glacial maximum. Epicrates c. chrysogaster appears to represent a single evolutionarily significant unit, a significant finding suggesting that conservation strategies focusing on ecologically intact populations might be more appropriate than alternate strategies involving near-impossible reversal of declining populations on heavily disturbed islands. In addition, reintroduction programs would likely not disrupt any significant historical population structure.},

	abstract = {The importance of genetic data in biodiversity conservation is well established, and knowledge of standing genetic variation within and between populations is important for designing conservation strategies. We investigated partitioning of genetic diversity in an endemic lizard (Leiocephalus psammodromus) distributed in the Turks and Caicos archipelago using mtDNA and AFLP data from 259 individuals sampled across 13 islands. Current taxonomy identifies six or more subspecies of L. psammodromus within the archipelago, several of which have undergone recent drastic reductions in range due to extirpation. However, our results indicate the presence of two independent lineages, one on each of the Turks and Caicos banks, and a third sympatric cryptic lineage on both banks. These lineages do not correspond to current taxonomy and alter our understanding of diversity and conservation of this species. Gross morphological data (mass and snout-vent length) indicate some variation in female size among lineages, indicating the possibility of cryptic morphological variation. Instead of initiating separate conservation measures for nominate subspecies, we recommend a more thorough investigation of the morphology and genetics of this group and a more inclusive conservation program. Our surprising results indicate that other endemic squamates in the Bahamas Archipelago might also exhibit sympatric cryptic diversity that does not correspond to current taxonomic understanding and could have significant impacts on our approach to conservation in this region. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Huehuecuetzpalli mixtecus gen. et sp. nov. is characterized by a combination of characters unlike those of any of the previously described Late Jurassic or Early Cretaceous lizards. It has most of the synapomorphies common to modern squamates, but still retains primitive features rare in living taxa. Autapomorphic characters include an anteroposteriorly elongated premaxilla that results in the elongation of the snout and the apparent retraction of the external nares. A small rounded postfrontal and a parietal foramen on the frontoparietal suture suggest affinities with iguanians, but the retention of divided premaxillae, amphicoelous vertebrae, thoracolumbar intercentra, entepicondylar foramen, and a second distal tarsal supports the hypothesis that Huehuecuetzpalli has a more basal position relative to the extant squamates. Although its appearance is late in the fossil record of lizards, Huehuecuetzpalli is the first report of a basal squamate. It provides important information on early transformation of characters in lizard evolution. Many primitive characters present in some modern squamates are usually explained by paedomorphosis; however, these characters are common in early lizards suggesting that derived states may have been fixed later in lizard evolution. If Huehuecuetzpalli is an iguanian, then it would be the earliest known representative of this lineage and extends their fossil record into the Albian. This paper presents an extensive review of the characters and character states used in previously published cladistic analyses of the Squamata. {\textcopyright} 1998 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {We used an individual-based Monte Carlo simulation model to explore how changes in the mean and variance of growth rates of individuals in a larval fish cohort interact with size-dependent predation to affect the number and characteristics of individual survivors. Small changes in initial cohort mean growth rate can change survival over the first 60 d of life 10- to 30-fold. But when variance in growth rate among individuals is high, survival can be substantially higher than expected from the initial mean cohort growth rate. Selection for faster-growing individuals becomes stronger with increasing variance and increasing predation rate. In some cases, {\textgreater}80{\%} of the survivors may come from the upper 25{\%} of the initial growth rate distribution, and the mean growth rate of the survivors may exceed twice the initial mean growth rate. When individual growth rates change from day to day rather than remaining constant, the contribution of atypical individuals is accentuated even further. Counterintuitively, most of the selection for faster-growing individuals happens only after the majority of mortality has already taken place. These results suggest that interactions between individual variability and selective mortality may have important cohort-level implications for survival in fishes.},

@article{Richardson2004,
	abstract = {The deleterious effects of inbreeding can be substantial in wild populations and mechanisms to avoid such matings have evolved in many organisms. In situations where social mate choice is restricted, extrapair paternity may be a strategy used by females to avoid inbreeding and increase offspring heterozygosity. In the cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler, Acrocephalus sechellensis, neither social nor extrapair mate choice was used to avoid inbreeding facultatively, and close inbreeding occurred in approximately 5{\%} of matings. However, a higher frequency of extra-group paternity may be selected for in female subordinates because this did reduce the frequency of mating between close relatives. Inbreeding resulted in reduced individual heterozygosity, which, against expectation, had an almost significant (P = 0.052), positive effect on survival. Conversely, low heterozygosity in the genetic mother was linked to reduced offspring survival, and the magnitude of this intergenerational inbreeding depression effect was environment-dependent. Because we controlled for genetic effects and most environmental effects (through the experimental cross-fostering of nestlings), we conclude that the reduced survival was a result of maternal effects. Our results show that inbreeding can have complicated effects even within a genetic bottlenecked population where the "purging" of recessive alleles is expected to reduce the effects of inbreeding depression.},

Our objectives were to (1) identify genetic variation within and among colonies across the landscape; (2) determine which factors are important in affecting genetic variation, including land use, habitat quality, and population size; and (3) determine whether genetic partitioning among populations exists and how this relates to (a) geographic distance between sites, (b) Gopher Tortoise natural history and spatial ecology, and (c) land-use history. We studied genetic variability of nine microsatellite DNA loci for 340 adult tortoises from 34 colonies separated by 1.3-45.1 km across a 56,000-ha military installation. Overall genetic variation was low across the landscape and within colonies. Observed heterozygosity (H(O)) of tortoise colonies was 49{\%} and allelic richness was 52{\%} of that found in populations located in the eastern portion of the species distribution where habitat is naturally more continuous. Our single colony with highest genetic variation had HO that was 57{\%} and allelic richness that was 60{\%} of eastern colonies. Genetic variation was greatest in sites with suitable habitat. We found weak to no genetic structure across the 45-km landscape (F(ST) = 0.031; D(ST) = 0.006) and evidence for only one genetic group (K). Although landscape reconfiguration to create sites for military activity has redistributed tortoise colonies and home ranges, we concluded that weak population structure is natural across our study area. Comparison to similar results from a cluster of connected eastern colonies suggests this is a general characteristic of tortoises across large, continuous landscapes and that populations are composed of multiple colonies across the landscape and are naturally large in spatial extent. To alleviate the tortoise-human land use conflict on Camp Shelby, Mississippi, USA and to ensure these created areas continue to benefit tortoises in the long term, maintenance of forest habitat surrounding these created open areas is required. We recommend managing tortoises at Camp Shelby as one unit.},

@article{Ricklefs2008,
	abstract = {Islands have long provided material and inspiration for the study of evolution and ecology. The West Indies are complex historically and geographically, providing a rich backdrop for the analysis of colonization, diversification and extinction of species. They are sufficiently isolated to sustain endemic forms and close enough to sources of colonists to develop a dynamic interaction with surrounding continental regions. The Greater Antilles comprise old fragments of continental crust, some very large; the Lesser Antilles are a more recent volcanic island arc, and the low-lying Bahama Islands are scattered on a shallow oceanic platform. Dating of island lineages using molecular methods indicates over-water dispersal of most inhabitants of the West Indies, although direct connections with what is now southern Mexico in the Early Tertiary, and subsequent land bridges or stepping stone islands linking to Central and South America might also have facilitated colonization. Species-area relationships within the West Indies suggest a strong role for endemic radiations and extinction in shaping patterns of diversity. Diversification is promoted by opportunities for allopatric divergence between islands, or within the large islands of the Greater Antilles, with a classic example provided by the Anolis lizards. The timing of colonization events using molecular clocks permits analysis of colonization-extinction dynamics by means of species accumulation curves. These indicate low rates of colonization and extinction for reptiles and amphibians in the Greater Antilles, with estimated average persistence times of lineages in the West Indies exceeding 30Myr. Even though individual island populations of birds might persist an average of 2Myr on larger islands in the Lesser Antilles, recolonization from within the archipelago appears to maintain avian lineages within the island chain indefinitely. Birds of the Lesser Antilles also provide evidence of a mass extinction event within the past million years, emphasizing the time-heterogeneity of historical processes. Geographical dynamics are matched by ecological changes in the distribution of species within islands over time resulting from adaptive radiation and shifts in habitat, often following repeatable patterns. Although extinction is relatively infrequent under natural conditions, changes in island environments as a result of human activities have exterminated many populations and others--especially old, endemic species--remain vulnerable. Conservation efforts are strengthened by recognition of aesthetic, cultural and scientific values of the unique flora and fauna of the West Indies.},

	abstract = {Effective population size (Ne ) is an important concept in the management of threatened species like bull trout Salvelinus confluentus. General guidelines suggest that effective population sizes of 50 or 500 are essential to minimize inbreeding effects or maintain adaptive genetic variation, respectively. Although Ne strongly depends on census population size, it also depends on demographic and life history characteristics that complicate any estimates. This is an especially difficult problem for species like bull trout, which have overlapping generations; biologists may monitor annual population number but lack more detailed information on demographic population structure or life history. We used a generalized, age-structured simulation model to relate Ne to adult numbers under a range of life histories and other conditions characteristic of bull trout populations. Effective population size varied strongly with the effects of the demographic and environmental variation included in our simulations. Our most realistic estimates of Ne were between about 0.5 and 1.0 times the mean number of adults spawning annually. We conclude that cautious long-term management goals for bull trout populations should include an average of at least 1,000 adults spawning each year. Where local populations are too small, managers should seek to conserve a collection of interconnected populations that is at least large enough in total to meet this minimum. It will also be important to provide for the full expression of life history variation and the natural processes of dispersal and gene flow.},

	abstract = {The origin of new homoploid species via hybridization is theoretically difficult because it requires the development of reproductive isolation in sympatry. Nonetheless, this mode is often and carelessly used by botanists to account for the formation of species that are morphologically intermediate with respect to related congeners. Here, I review experimental, theoretical, and empirical studies of homoploid hybrid speciation to evaluate the feasibility, tempo, and frequency of this mode. Theoretical models, simulation studies, and experimental syntheses of stabilized hybrid neospecies indicate that it is feasible, although evolutionary conditions are stringent. Hybrid speciation appears to be promoted by rapid chromosomal evolution and the availability of a suitable hybrid habitat. A selfing breeding system may enhance establishment of hybrid species, but this advantage appears to be counterbalanced by lower rates of natural hybridization among selfing taxa. Simulation studies and crossing experiments also suggest that hybrid speciation can be rapid - a prediction confirmed by the congruence observed between the genomes of early generation hybrids and ancient hybrid species. The frequency of this mode is less clear. Only eight natural examples in plants have been rigorously documented, suggesting that it may be rare. However, hybridization rates are highest in small or peripheral populations, and hybridization may be important as a stimulus for the genetic or chromosomal reorganization envisioned in founder effect and saltational models of speciation.},

	abstract = {In several studies, heterozygosity measured at around 10 microsatellite markers correlates with parasite load. Usually the effect size is small, but while this may reflect reality, it may also be possible that too few markers are used or the measure of fitness contains too much error to reveal what is actually a much stronger underlying effect. Here, we analysed over 200 stranded harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) for an association between lungworm burden and heterozygosity, conducting thorough necropsies on the seals and genotyping the samples obtained for 27 microsatellites. We found that homozygosity predicts higher worm burdens, but only in young animals, where the worms have the greatest impact on fitness. Testing each locus separately, we found that a significant majority reveal a weak but similar trend for heterozygosity to be protective against high lungworm burden, suggesting a genome-wide effect, that is, inbreeding. This conclusion is supported by the fact that heterozygosity is correlated among markers in young animals but not in otherwise equivalent older ones. Taken as a whole, our results support the notion that homozygosity increases susceptibility to parasitic infection and suggest that parasites can be effective in removing inbred individuals from the population.},

	abstract = {This study develops a mixed, systematic, low-cost methodology to define and map native vegetation and the spread of the most aggressive invasive species in islands biomes, focusing on the Gal{\'{a}}pagos National Park (GNP). Based on preliminary legends defined by experts, Landsat 8/OLI fusion imagery was used for object-oriented classification to obtain the vegetation map of this archipelago. This technique was later verified and validated using high-resolution images from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, i.e., drones) and dedicated satellites, ground truthing, and visual confirmation around GNP coasts. This mixed methodology allowed mapping of nine native ecosystems, six invasive-dominated vegetation units, and two types of lavas. Around 53.63{\%} of GNP is covered by native ecosystems and ∼2.2{\%} is ``canopy'' dominated by invasive species to date. Native-dominated deciduous forest types cover ∼40.8{\%} of the GNP and only ∼12.8{\%} of the protected area is nowadays covered by humid and transitional type native ecosystems. Among humid native ecosystems, those distributed in the highlands only cover 4.8{\%} and are highly threatened by invasive species, which are mostly distributed in these summit areas. Of the five islands (out of 18) recording invasive-dominated units, Isabela and Santa Cruz were the most infested. Cedrela odorata, Pennisetum purpureum, and Psidium guajava were the main invasive plants dominating the GNP canopy. Highly noxious Rubus niveus was the only invasive species dominating areas among the five infested islands. Methodology detailed here proved useful to provide accurate spatially-explicit islands vegetation data, potential for replication in time, and is expected to aid suitable management of highly endangered and unique biotas in this and other tropical island biomes.},

To address this gap, we integrate range-wide genetic analysis with IUCN Red List assessments. We calculated the loss of genetic diversity under simulated range loss for species of Delonix (Leguminosae). Simulated range loss involved random loss of populations and was intended to model ongoing habitat destruction. We found a strong relationship between loss of genetic diversity and range. Moreover, we found correspondence between levels of genetic diversity and thresholds for 'non-threatened' versus 'threatened' IUCN Red List categories. Our results support the view that current threat thresholds of the IUCN Red List criteria reflect genetic diversity, and hence evolutionary potential; although the genetic diversity distinction between threatened categories was less evident. Thus, by supplementing conventional conservation assessments with genetic data, new insights into the biological robustness of IUCN Red List assessments for targeted conservation initiatives can be achieved.},

@article{Robertson2014,
	abstract = {Abstract. Islands host exceptionally high levels of endemism compared to mainland regions and are subject to disproportionately high rates of extinction and imperilment. Therefore, the protection and preservation of taxonomic units that are endemic to islands is a key component in mitigating the loss of global biodiversity. However, determining what is ``endemic'' on islands can be challenging. Conservation units are commonly delineated based on genetic divergence at neutral loci (e.g., genetic differentiation at microsatellite loci or reciprocal monophyly based on mitochondrial genes). Island populations of nonvolant species are expected to meet this criterion, regardless of adaptive differences, due to geographic isolation, founder effects, and small effective population sizes. We therefore argue that the delineation and management of island endemic populations should not be based on neutral genetic divergence and reciprocal monophyly alone. Instead, we recommend identifying island populations that have genetically based adaptations to their unique environments. A comprehensive framework specifically designed to delineate evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) on islands should be based on metrics of both neutral and adaptive genetic divergence. The California Channel Islands host several taxa considered to be endemic, and we highlight 2 case studies to illustrate how this framework can be applied. This approach can be applied broadly to continental islands and island archipelagos, enabling conservation practitioners to use an objective framework to prioritize units of biological diversity for management. , Resumen. Las islas albergan niveles excepcionalmente altos de especies end{\'{e}}micas en comparaci{\'{o}}n con las regiones continentales, y est{\'{a}}n sujetas a niveles desproporcionadamente altos de extinci{\'{o}}n y peligro. La protecci{\'{o}}n y conservaci{\'{o}}n de las unidades taxon{\'{o}}micas que son end{\'{e}}micas de las islas es, por lo tanto, un componente clave para mitigar la p{\'{e}}rdida global de biodiversidad. Sin embargo, determinar qu{\'{e}} es ``end{\'{e}}mico'' en las islas puede ser un reto. Las unidades de conservaci{\'{o}}n son com{\'{u}}nmente delineadas bas{\'{a}}ndose en divergencias gen{\'{e}}ticas en lugares neutrales (por ejemplo, diferenciaci{\'{o}}n gen{\'{e}}tica en loci microsatelitales o monofilia rec{\'{i}}proca basada en genes mitocondriales). Se espera que las poblaciones de las islas de especies que no pueden volar re{\'{u}}nan estos criterios, independientemente de diferencias de adaptaci{\'{o}}n, debido al aislamiento geogr{\'{a}}fico, efectos de hundimiento y un tama{\~{n}}o de poblaci{\'{o}}n efectivo peque{\~{n}}o. Por lo tanto, argumentamos que la delineaci{\'{o}}n y el tratamiento de las poblaciones end{\'{e}}micas de la isla no deber{\'{i}}an estar basados s{\'{o}}lo en la divergencia gen{\'{e}}tica neutral y en monofilia rec{\'{i}}proca. En lugar de eso, nosotros apoyamos la identificaci{\'{o}}n de poblaciones de la isla que tienen adaptaciones basadas gen{\'{e}}ticamente exclusivamente para su propio ambiente. Un marco comprensible espec{\'{i}}ficamente dise{\~{n}}ado para describir unidades evolutivamente importantes (UEIs) en las islas deber{\'{i}}a estar basado en ambas mediciones, tanto en la neutral como en la divergencia gen{\'{e}}tica adaptativa. Las Islas del Canal de California albergan varios taxa que se consideran end{\'{e}}micos, y destacamos 2 casos pr{\'{a}}cticos para ilustrar como se puede aplicar esta estrategia. Este enfoque puede ser ampliamente aplicado a las islas continentales y a las islas del archipi{\'{e}}lago, permitiendo a los profesionales de la conservaci{\'{o}}n aplicar una estrategia objetiva para priorizar unidades de diversidad biol{\'{o}}gica para su manejo.},

	abstract = {Differences between island- and mainland-dwelling forms provide several classic ecological puzzles. Why, for instance, are island-dwelling passerine birds consistently larger than their mainland counterparts? We examine the 'Dominance hypothesis', based on intraspecific competition, which states that large size in island passerines evolves through selection for success in agonistic encounters. We use the Heron Island population of Capricorn silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis chlorocephalus), a large-bodied island-dwelling race of white-eye (Zosteropidae), to test three assumptions of this hypothesis; that (i) large size is positively associated with high fitness, (ii) large size is associated with dominance, and (iii) the relationship between size and dominance is particularly pronounced under extreme intraspecific competition. Our results supported the first two of these assumptions, but provided mixed evidence on the third. On balance, we suggest that the Dominance Hypothesis is a plausible mechanism for the evolution of large size of island passerines, but urge further empirical tests on the role of intraspecific competition on oceanic islands versus that on mainlands.},

	abstract = {Estimates of effective population size are critical for species of conservation concern. Genetic datasets can be used to provide robust estimates of this important parameter. However, the methods used to obtain these estimates assume that generations are discrete. We used simulated data to assess the influences of overlapping generations on the estimates of effective size provided by the linkage disequilibrium (LD) method. Our simulations focus on two factors: the degree of reproductive skew exhibited by the focal species and the generation time, without considering sample size or the level of polymorphism at marker loci. In situations where a majority of reproduction is achieved by a small fraction of the population, the effective number of breeders can be much smaller than the per-generation effective population size. The LD in samples of newborns can provide estimates of the former size, while our results indicate that the latter size is best estimated using random samples of reproductively mature adults. Using samples of adults, the downwards bias was less than approximately 15{\%} across our simulated life histories. As noted in previous assessments, precision of the estimate depends on the magnitude of effective size itself, with greater precision achieved for small populations.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim Some species reach extraordinary densities on islands. Island assemblages have fewer species, however, and it is possible that island species differ from their mainland counterparts in average mass. Island assemblages could be partitioned differently (fewer species or smaller individuals) from mainland sites without differing in aggregate biomass (density compensation). Our objective was to determine the generality of excess density compensation in island herpetofaunal assemblages. Location Our bounded removal plot data were obtained from Pacific Island sites (Guam, Saipan and Rota), the West Indies (British Virgin Islands), and the Indian Ocean (Ile aux Aigrettes off Mauritius). The literature values were taken from several locales. Other island locations included Barro Colorado Island, Bonaire, Borneo, Philippine Islands, Seychelle Islands, Barrow Island (Australia), North Brother Island (New Zealand), Dominica and Puerto Rico. Mainland sites included Costa Rica, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Australia, Thailand, Peru, Brazil, Panama and the USA. Method We added our thirty-nine bounded total removal plots from sixteen island habitats to fifteen literature records to obtain seventy-five venues with estimable density and biomass of arboreal or terrestrial herpetofaunal assemblages. These biomass estimates were evaluated geographically and in relation to sampling method, insularity, latitude, disturbance regime, seasonality, community richness, vegetative structure and climate. Direct data on trophic interactions (food availability, parasitism and predation pressure) were generally unavailable. Sampling problems were frequent for arboreal, cryptic and evasive species. Results and main conclusions We found strong evidence that herpetofaunal assem- blages on small islands (mostly lizards) exhibit a much greater aggregate density of biomass (kg ha)1) than those of larger islands or mainland assemblages (small islands show excess density compensation). High aggregate biomass density was more strongly associated with the degree of species impoverishment on islands than it was on island area or insularity per se. High aggregate biomass density was not strongly associated with latitude, precipitation, canopy height or a variety of other physical characteristics of the study sites. The association between high aggregate biomass density and species-poor islands is consistent with the effects of a reduced suite of predators on depauperate islands, but other features may also contribute to excess density compensation.},

	abstract = {Mussels,Mytilus edulis L., were collected from the lower shore in Stony Brook Harbor, New York, USA, in April 1984. The mussels were in spawning condition at the time of collection. Mantle weight was used as an index of fecundity and somatic tissue weight and growth rate were measured so that the relative production of gametes and somatic tissue with age could be calculated. For each individual mussel the genotypes at loci coding for five enzymes were determined. Somatic tissue production exceeds gamete production for the first two and a half years of life, but thereafter it declines and is exceeded by gamete production. There is a positive correlation between multiple-locus enzyme heterozygosity and fecundity in mussels which have grown beyond the size at which gamete production starts to exceed somatic production. There is no correlation between heterozygosity and fecundity in younger individuals. We conclude that the higher scope for growth of more heterozygous bivalves, described elsewhere, is translated into allocation of energy to somatic growth during early life and into gamete production in later life. Our observations perhaps explain why, in other studies, the correlation between growth rate and heterozygosity in bivalves is manifested most clearly when young individuals are examined.},

	abstract = {Habitat fragmentation reduces the extent and connectivity of suitable habitats, and can lead to changes in population genetic structure. Limited gene flow among isolated demes can result in increased genetic divergence among populations, and decreased genetic diversity within demes. We assessed patterns of genetic variation in the Caribbean boa Chilabothrus monensis (Epicrates monensis) using two mitochondrial and seven nuclear markers, and relying on the largest number of specimens of these snakes examined to date. Two disjunct subspecies of C. monensis are recognized: the threatened C. m. monensis, endemic to Mona Island, and the rare and endangered C. m. granti, which occurs on various islands of the Puerto Rican Bank. Mitochondrial and nuclear markers revealed unambiguous genetic differences between the taxa, and coalescent species delimitation methods indicated that these snakes likely are different evolutionary lineages, which we recognize at the species level, C. monensis and C. granti. All examined loci in C. monensis (sensu stricto) are monomorphic, which may indicate a recent bottleneck event. Each population of C. granti exclusively contains private mtDNA haplotypes, but five of the seven nuclear genes assayed are monomorphic, and nucleotide diversity is low in the two remaining markers. The faster pace of evolution of mtDNA possibly reflects the present-day isolation of populations of C. granti, whereas the slower substitution rate of nuDNA may instead mirror the relatively recent episodes of connectivity among the populations facilitated by the lower sea level during the Pleistocene. The small degree of overall genetic variation in C. granti suggests that demes of this snake could be managed as a single unit, a practice that would significantly increase their effective population size.},

	abstract = {Aim We investigated the evolutionary relationships and historical biogeography of two lizard species (Anolis desechensis and Anolis monensis) endemic to small oceanic islands in the eastern Caribbean Sea. Location Desecheo, Mona and Monito Islands, in the Mona Passage, and Puerto Rico, eastern Caribbean Sea. Methods We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of A. desechensis and A. monensis from DNA sequences of two mitochondrial genes using maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference and maximum parsimony methods. The ingroup included species from Puerto Rico (Anolis cooki, Anolis cristatellus), the Bahamas (Anolis scriptus), and the British Virgin Islands (Anolis ernestwilliamsi). We also constructed a median-joining mutational network to visualize relationships among the haplotypes of A. cooki and A. monensis from Mona and Monito Islands. Results The three phylogenetic methods suggested the same pattern of relationships. Anolis desechensis nests within A. cristatellus, and is most closely related to A. cristatellus from south-western Puerto Rico. Our analyses also indicated that A. monensis is the sister species of A. cooki, an anole restricted to the south-western coast of Puerto Rico. Although they are closely related, the populations of A. monensis from Mona and Monito can be distinguished genetically. Main conclusions The ancestors of A. desechensis and A. monensis colonized Desecheo, and Mona and Monito Islands, respectively, from localities in south-western Puerto Rico, not from places on Puerto Rico geographically closer to the islands. The ancestors of these two anoline species probably arrived on the islands via waif dispersal. Anolis eggs can survive immersion in salt water for several hours, thus flotsam could successfully have transported all developmental stages of these lizards from the source area to a new locality.},

	abstract = {Mate finding in most moth species involves long-distance signaling via female-emitted sex pheromones. There is a great diversity of pheromone structures used throughout the Lepidoptera, even among closely related species. The conundrum is how signal divergence has occurred. With strong normalizing selection pressure on blend composition and response preferences, it is improbable that shifts to pheromones of diverse structures occur through adaptive changes in small steps. Here, we present data supporting the hypothesis that a major shift in the pheromone of an Ostrinia species occurred by activation of a nonfunctional desaturase gene transcript present in the pheromone gland. We also demonstrate the existence of rare males that respond to the new pheromone blend. Their presence would allow for asymmetric tracking of male response to the new blend and, thus, evolution of an Ostrinia species with structurally different sex pheromone components.$\backslash$n},

	abstract = {Inheritance patterns for sex pheromone production in females, pheromone detection on male antennal olfactory receptor cells, and male pheromone behavioral responses were studied in pheromonally distinct populations of European corn borers from New York State. Gas chromatographic analyses of pheromone glands, single sensillum recordings, and flight tunnel behavioral analyses were carried out on progeny from reciprocal crosses, as well as on progeny from subsequent F(2) and maternal and paternal backcrosses. The data show that the production of the female pheromone blend primarily is controlled by a single autosomal factor, that pheromone-responding olfactory cells are controlled by another autosomal factor, and that behavioral response to pheromone is controlled by a sex-linked gene. F(1) males were found to possess olfactory receptor cells that give spike amplitudes to the two pheromone isomers that are intermediate to those of the high and low amplitude cells of the parent populations. Fifty-five percent of the F(1) males tested responded fully to pheromone sources ranging from the hybrid (E)-11-tetradecenyl acetate/(Z)-11-tetradecenyl acetate (E/Z) molar blend of 65:35 to the E/Z molar blend of 3:97 for the Z morph parents, but very few responded to the E/Z molar blend of 99:1 for the E morph parents. Data on the inheritance patterns support speculation that the Z morph is the ancestral and that the E morph is the derived European corn borer population.},

The shape of this curve reflects natural selection, admixture between populations, and the history of population size. The present article derives new results about the last of these effects. When a population expands in size, the LD curve grows steeper, and this effect is especially pronounced following a bottleneck in population size. When a population shrinks, the LD curve rises but remains relatively flat. As LD converges toward a new equilibrium, its time path may not be monotonic. Following an episode of growth, for example, it declines to a low value before rising toward the new equilibrium. These changes happen at different rates for different LD statistics. They are especially slow for estimates of $\sigma$(2) d, which therefore allow inferences about ancient population history. For the human population of Europe, these results suggest a history of population growth.},

Thus, the population-level corticosterone response was variable but nevertheless predicted overall population health.

Photographic Identification Method (PIM) has obtained favorable opinions, being effective and less intrusive with respect to traditional marking procedures. Here, we developed and tested the efficacy of a software-aided PIM based on different characteristics, which act as natural marks. Target species were the northern spectacled salamander (Salamandrina perspicillata, Amphibia: Urodela) and the stag beetle (Lucanus cervus, Coleoptera: Lucanidae). We considered as natural mark the ventral pattern of S. perspicillata and, for the first time in L. cervus, the presence/number of small denticles on male mandibles. We selected 4 independent characteristics, each one with several states, for each species. We asked participants, with different degree of familiarity with the species, to identify recaptured individuals through manual PIM. To assess the advantages of the software, we compared the time spent by experts of the species to identify an individual through manual PIM and software-aided PIM. We further compared our semi-automated method with a fully automated one. The software efficiency was calculated by increasing the number of characteristics used to filter individuals from the database (from 1 to 4). The chosen characteristics proved their reliability for individual identification and can be used as natural marks. The proposed software-aided PIM shorten the identification time, does not led to mismatching errors and proved its efficacy regardless of the taxa/characteristic used. Thus, this tool can be consider a more practical alternative to conventional marking techniques, in particular for sensitive and threatened species that need quick and effective monitoring programs carried out with non-invasive sampling},

The aim of the study was to estimate gene flow in a metapopulation for assessing and managing the risks of transgene introgression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Wild carrots (Daucus carota) were sampled from 12 patches in a metapopulation. Eleven microsatellites were used to genotype wild carrots. Genetic structure was estimated based on the FST statistic. Contemporary (over the last several generations) and historical (over many generations) gene flow was estimated with assignment and coalescent methods, respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS: The genetic structure in the wild carrot metapopulation was moderate (FST = 0{\textperiodcentered}082) and most of the genetic variation resided within patches. A pattern of isolation by distance was detected, suggesting that most of the gene flow occurred between neighbouring patches (≤1 km). The mean contemporary gene flow was 5 times higher than the historical estimate, and the correlation between them was very low. Moreover, the contemporary gene flow in roadsides was twice that in a nature reserve, and the correlation between contemporary and historical estimates was much higher in the nature reserve. Mowing of roadsides may contribute to the increase in contemporary gene flow. Simulations demonstrated that the higher contemporary gene flow could accelerate the process of transgene introgression in the metapopulation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Human disturbance such as mowing may alter gene flow patterns in wild populations, affecting the metapopulation dynamics of wild plants and the processes of transgene introgression in the metapopulation. The risk assessment and management of transgene introgression and the control of weeds need to take metapopulation dynamics into consideration.},

	abstract = {In reconstructing the history of host-parasite associations, it is necessary to consider several different processes, such as cospeciation and host switching, that may affect an association. A simple reconstruction method is to maximise the number of host-parasite cospeciations. However, maximum cospeciation reconstruction may require the postulation of a large number of other kinds of events, such as parasite extlncdon or exclusion fi'om certain hosts. A more sophisticated method associates each kind of event with a cost or weight which is inversely related to the likelihood of that kind of event occurring. I present a method of the latter type that distinguishes between two different processes: host tracking, of which cospeciation is a special case, and host switching. Given a relative weight for these two types of events, it is possible to convert the host phylogeny into a cost matrix, allowing for host switching, and use generalised-parsimony algorithms to fred minimum-cost reconstructions of the history of the host-parasite association. Different relative switch weights give different minimum-cost reconstructions; the optimal switch weight can be found by maximising the fit between the tracking events and the parasite phylogeny, controlling for the number of postulated switches. As an empirical application of the method, data on an association between pocket gophers and their parasitic chewing lice were re-examined. Although these data have been extensively analysed previously, the generalised parsimony approach throws new light on the history of the association.},

For the island models, statistical approaches are now well developed and typically offer more de- tailed insight than parsimony analysis.

@article{Rosen1975,
	abstract = {Caribbean biogeography is reviewed to illustrate within a particular geographic framework how evidence of plant and animal distribution may be interpreted without commitment to special assumptions other than allopatric speciation (vicariance). The distributional data are examined with respect to whether or not they form recognizable patterns within the Caribbean region. Four main patterns and one lesser pattern are identified. The patterns or generalized distributional tracks are regions or geographical features (e.g., islands, coastlines, oceanic and continental regions) in which the distributions of monophyletic groups of diverse organisms are coincident. The generalized tracks are compared with geophysical theories of Caribbean history. The one geophysical theory which is strongly consistent with the distributional evidence (generalized tracks) specifies that Antillean land was originally or had its origin as part of an early lower Central American archipelago that was later replaced by the tectonically and topographically similar, presentday, lower Central American land. The postulated events associated with this replacement involve continental drift, the main effect of which would have been to intrude a portion of the eastern Pacific sea floor into the tropical western Atlantic, carrying the early lower Central American archipelago with it. The hypothesized intruded sea floor, now forming the Caribbean Sea, is bounded on the north and east by a transposed, original archipelago, the Antilles, and on the west by a new archipelago, now represented by the continuous land of present-day lower Central America. The separate parts of each generalized track are interpreted as the remnants of an ancestral biota that underwent geographical fragmentation followed by allopatric speciation (vicariance). This vicariance model of Caribbean biogeography specifies where dispersal, rather than vicariance, is the most parsimonious interpretation of a particular individual distribution, and contrasts strongly with other biogeographic interpretations in which dispersal is assumed aprioristically to be the sole, or single most important, feature of Caribbean biotic history. The vicariance model is also shown to predict, and therefore to be tested by, phylogenies (cladograms) of geographically included taxa.},

	abstract = {Using PCR and an automated laser fluorescent DNA sequencer, we amplified and sequenced a 1,234-bp fragment of the citrate synthase-encoding gene (gU) of 28 bacteria belonging to the genus Rickettsia. Com- parative sequence analysis showed that most of the spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae belonged to one of two subgroups. The first subgroup included Rickettsia massiliae, strain Bar 29, Rickettsia rhipicephali, ``Rickettsia aeschlimanni,'' and Rickettsia montana, which have been isolated only from ticks. The second subgroup was larger and included the majority of the human pathogens and also rickettsiae isolated only from ticks; the members of this subgroup were strain S, Rickettsia apicae, ``Rickettsia mongolotimonae,'' Rickettsia sibirica, Rickettsia parkeri, Rickettsia conorii, Rickettsia rickettsii, the Thai tick typhus rickettsia, the Israeli tick typhus rickettsia, the Astrakhan fever rickettsia, ``Rickettsia slovaca,'' and Rickettsia japonica. The sequence analysis also showed that the tick-borne organisms Rickettsia helvetica and Rickettsia australis and the mite-borne organism Rickettsia akari were associated with the SFG cluster; that Rickettsia prowazekii and Rickettsia typhi, two representatives of the typhus group, clustered together; and that Rickettsia Canada, Rickettsia bellii, and the AB bacterium probably represent three new groups. We compared the phylogenetic trees inferred from citrate synthase gene sequences and from 16s ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences. For rickettsial phylogeny, the citrate synthase approach was more suitable, as demonstrated by significant bootstrap values for all of the nodes except those in the larger subgroup defined above. We also compared phylogenetic analysis results obtained in a comparison of the sequences of both genes for all of the representatives of the domain Bacteria for which the gZtA sequence was determined. We believe that comparison of glL4 sequences could be a complementary approach to 16s rDNA sequencing for inferring bacterial evolution, especially when unstable phylogenetic models are obtained from ribosomal sequences because of high levels of sequence similarity between the bacteria studied.},

	abstract = {Dispersal is a fundamental attribute of species in nature and shapes population dynamics, evolutionary trajectories and genetic variation across spatial and temporal scales. It is increasingly clear that landscape features have large impacts on dispersal patterns. Thus, understanding how individuals and species move through landscapes is essential for predicting impacts of landscape alterations. Information on dispersal patterns, however, is lacking for many taxa, particularly reptiles. Eastern foxsnakes (Mintoinus gloydi) are marsh and prairie specialists that avoid agricultural fields, but they have persisted across a fragmented region in southwestern Ontario and northern Ohio. Here, we combined habitat suitability modelling with population genetic analyses to infer how foxsnakes disperse through a habitat mosaic of natural and altered landscape features. Boundary regions between the eight genetic clusters, identified through assignment tests, were comprised of low suitability habitat (e.g. agricultural fields). Island populations were grouped into a single genetic cluster, and comparatively low F(ST) values between island and mainland populations suggest open water presents less of a barrier than nonsuitable terrestrial habitat. Isolation by resistance and least-cost path analysis produced similar results with matrices of pairwise individual genetic distance significantly more correlated to matrices of resistance values derived from habitat suitability than models with an undifferentiated landscape. Spatial autocorrelation results matched better with assignment results when incorporating resistance values rather than straight-line distances. All analyses used in our study produced similar results suggesting that habitat degradation limits dispersal for foxsnakes, which has had a strong effect on the genetic population structure across this region.},

Primer3 can also select single primers for sequencing reactions and can design oligonucleotide hybridization probes. In selecting oligos for primers or hybridization probes, Primer3 can con- sider many factors. These include oligo melting temperature, length, GC con- tent, 3′ stability, estimated secondary structure, the likelihood of annealing to or amplifying undesirable sequences (for example interspersed repeats), the likelihood of primer--dimer formation between two copies of the same primer, and the accuracy of the source sequence. In the design of primer pairs Primer3 can consider product size and melting temperature, the likelihood of primer-- dimer formation between the two primers in the pair, the difference between primer melting temperatures, and primer location relative to particular regions of interest or to be avoided},

@article{Rubinoff2006a,
	abstract = {Molecular tools are a standard part of many conservation studies and can be informative at many different levels of analysis, although there are inherent limitations and strengths of different genes or parts of genes to inform specific questions. Animal DNA barcodes, 600- to 800-base-pair segments of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I, have been proposed as a means to quantify global biodiversity. Although mitochondrial (mt) DNA has a long history of use at the species level, recent analyses suggest that the use of a single gene, particularly mitochondrial, is unlikely to yield data that are balanced, universally acceptable, or sufficient in taxonomic scope to recognize many species lineages. Mitochondrial and nuclear genomes have different patterns of evolution and modes of inheritance, which can result in very different assessments of biodiversity. The ramifications of choosing a particular definition of species (species concept) need to be carefully considered because current efforts have designated DNA barcodes as the universal species concept without demonstrating its superiority over preexisting concepts. The results of such a barcoding paradigm may include a failure to recognize significant portions of biodiversity or nuclear/mitochondrial mixed lineages and could spuriously focus conservation resources on populations with relatively minor mtDNA divergence. DNA barcodes are most likely to provide potentially useful information for groups that are already well studied, and such taxa do not constitute the majority of biodiversity or those in most need of research attention. DNA barcode-length sequences are an important source of data but, when used alone or out of context, may offer only a fraction of the information needed to characterize species while taking resources from broader studies that could produce information essential to robust and informed conservation decisions.},

@article{Ruiz-Lopez2012,
	abstract = {The relation among inbreeding, heterozygosity, and fitness has been studied primarily among outbred populations, and little is known about these phenomena in endangered populations. Most researchers conclude that the relation between coefficient of inbreeding estimated from pedigrees and fitness traits (inbreeding-fitness correlations) better reflects inbreeding depression than the relation between marker heterozygosity and fitness traits (heterozygosity-fitness correlations). However, it has been suggested recently that heterozygosity-fitness correlations should only be expected when inbreeding generates extensive identity disequilibrium (correlations in heterozygosity and homozygosity across loci throughout the genome). We tested this hypothesis in Mohor gazelle (Gazella dama mhorr) and Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus). For Mohor gazelle, we calculated the inbreeding coefficient and measured heterozygosity at 17 microsatellite loci. For Iberian lynx, we measured heterozygosity at 36 microsatellite loci. In both species we estimated semen quality, a phenotypic trait directly related to fitness that is controlled by many loci and is affected by inbreeding depression. Both species showed evidence of extensive identity disequilibrium, and in both species heterozygosity was associated with semen quality. In the Iberian lynx the low proportion of normal sperm associated with low levels of heterozygosity was so extreme that it is likely to limit the fertility of males. In Mohor gazelle, although heterozygosity was associated with semen quality, inbreeding coefficient was not. This result suggests that when coefficient of inbreeding is calculated on the basis of a genealogy that begins after a long history of inbreeding, the coefficient of inbreeding fails to capture previous demographic information because it is a poor estimator of accumulated individual inbreeding. We conclude that among highly endangered species with extensive identity disequilibrium, examination of heterozygosity-fitness correlations may be an effective way to detect inbreeding depression, whereas inbreeding-fitness correlations may be poor indicators of inbreeding depression if the pedigree does not accurately reflect the history of inbreeding.},

	abstract = {Differences in integumentary permeability dictate alternative life history strategies in amphibians and reptiles. Limiting resources for amphibians are chiefly associated with availability of water and, as a consequence, amphibian migrations are chiefly associated with movements to and from aquatic breeding habitats. These cyclic migrations from breeding to overwintering sites may be direct, or may be interrupted by periods of residence at foraging sites. In general, migrations take place over relatively short distances and are constrained by the problem of water balance associated with exposure during longer overland journeys. Many amphibians exhibit complex mechanisms of orientation involving multiple sensory modalities and are capable of precise homing abilities. Among reptiles, migrations are chiefly associated with travel to and from egg laying sites, as displayed by turtles, or communal hibernacula, as is characteristic of some snakes. Marine turtles, in particular, undertake long distance migrations (up to thousands of kilometers) to reach nesting beaches and, sometimes, foraging grounds. In these chelonians, complex patterns of movement vary ontogenetically, as well as by gender and species. A variety of cues are used to locate destinations, including celestial, geomagnetic, olfactory, auditory, thermal, wave, and current pattern signals; however, evidence of a map-compass system of navigation is equivocal. The migratory patterns of amphibians and reptiles often bring them into conflict with human resource utilization. For amphibians, breeding migrations that cross busy roads or areas turned over to agricultural production lead to mass mortality. Marine turtle migratory pathways often result in conflicts with fishery activities. Knowledge of life history strategies and associated migratory behavior is essential for effective conservation measures. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

	abstract = {Monitoring marine resource exploitation is a key activity in fisheries science and biodiversity conservation. Since research surveys are time-consuming and costly, fishery-dependent data (i.e. derived directly from fishing vessels) are increasingly credited with a key role in expanding the reach of ocean monitoring. Fishing vessels may be seen as widely ranging data-collecting platforms, which could act as a fleet of sentinels for monitoring marine life, in particular exploited stocks. Here, we investigate the possibility of assessing catch composition of single hauls carried out by trawlers by applying DNA metabarcoding to the ``slush'' collected from fishing nets just after the end of hauling operations. We assess the performance of this approach in portraying $\beta$-diversity and examining the quantitative relationship between species abundances in the catch and DNA amount in the slush (reads counts generated by amplicon sequencing). We demonstrate that the assemblages identified using DNA in the slush mirror those returned by visual inspection of net content and detect a strong relationship between read counts and species abundances in the catch. We therefore argue that this approach could be upscaled to serve as a powerful source of information on the structure of demersal assemblages and the impact of fisheries. {\#}{\#}{\#} Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {New Caledonian crows Corvus moneduloides are the most prolific avian tool users. It has been suggested that some aspects of their complex tool use behaviour are under the influence of cultural processes, involving the social transmission-and perhaps even progressive refinement-of tool designs. Using microsatellite and mt-haplotype profiling of crows from three distinct habitats (dry forest, farmland and beachside habitat), we show that New Caledonian crow populations can exhibit significant fine-scale genetic structuring. Our finding that some sites of {\textless}10 km apart were highly differentiated demonstrates considerable potential for genetic and/or cultural isolation of crow groups. Restricted movement of birds between local populations at such small spatial scales, especially across habitat boundaries, illustrates how specific tool designs could be preserved over time, and how tool technologies of different crow groups could diverge due to drift and local selection pressures. Young New Caledonian crows have an unusually long juvenile dependency period, during which they acquire complex tool-related foraging skills. We suggest that the resulting delayed natal dispersal drives population-divergence patterns in this species. Our work provides essential context for future studies that examine the genetic makeup of crow populations across larger geographic areas, including localities with suspected cultural differences in crow tool technologies.},

"Identification of ESUs was recognized as a difficult task, requiring the use of natural history information, morphometrics, range and distribution data, as well as protein electrophoresis, cytogenetic analysis, and restriction mapping of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. The recognition of inevitable uncertainty in the classification of potentially significant populations led to a recommendation that concordance between sets of data derived by different techniques be a criterion identifying ESUs, Thus, when geographic distribution data indicate the existence of discrete populations within the range of a species, an estimate of genetic distance, for example, should be made to determine whether the populations have ESU status."},

	abstract = {In the last two decades our knowledge of the biology of the highly threatened rock iguanas (Cyclura) has been expanding. However, most studies have focused on the adults and none has been conducted to document the biology of the younger stages. In some instances, such as the Mona Island iguana (Cyclura cornuta stejnegeri), the biology of young stages has been overlooked due to their low relative abundance in the population. The causes of this population trait remain unknown and their extent from the conservation perspective is important because the scarcity of young stages has been considered a symptom of a declining population. We used radio telemetry to document life history of Mona Island iguana hatchlings during the first five months of life. Hatchlings dispersed following specific individual bearings from 102 m to 5080 m from the releases sites. Hatchlings settled down in diverse habitats used or not used by adult iguanas. Once settled, hatchlings spent most of the time (63{\%}) in trees or perch locations above the ground. We report a conservative survival rate of 22{\%} during the study period and Minimum Convex Polygon home ranges that vary from 0 m 2 to 530 m 2 (mean = 297). Our results suggest that the low relative abundance of the juvenile stages in the population is caused both by high predation rates during their dispersal phase, and hatchling microhabitat selection which precludes their detection in population surveys. {\textcopyright} 2007 Brill Academic Publishers.},

	abstract = {The evolution of the main regulatory region (D-loop) of the mammalian mitochondrial genome was analyzed by comparing the sequences of eight mammalian species: human, common chimpanzee, pygmy chimpanzee, dolphin, cow, rat, mouse, and rabbit. The best alignment of the sequences was obtained by optimization of the sequence similarities common to all these species. The two peripheral left and right D-loop domains, which contain the main regulatory elements so far discovered, evolved rapidly in a species-specific manner generating heterogeneity in both length and base composition. They are prone to the insertion and deletion of elements and to the generation of short repeats by replication slippage. However, the preservation of some sequence blocks and similar cloverleaf-like structures in these regions, indicates a basic similarity in the regulatory mechanisms of the mitochondrial genome in all mammalian species. We found, particularly in the right domain, significant similarities to the telomeric sequences of the mitochondrial (mt) and nuclear DNA of Tetrahymena thermophila. These sequences may be interpreted as relics of telomeres present in ancestral linear forms of mtDNA or may simply represent efficient templates of RNA primase-like enzymes. Due to their peculiar evolution, the two peripheral domains cannot be used to estimate in a quantitative way the genetic distances between mammalian species. On the other hand the central domain, highly conserved during evolution, behaves as a good molecular clock. Reliable estimates of the times of divergence between closely and distantly related species were obtained from the central domain using a Markov model and assuming nonhomogeneous evolution of nucleotide sites. {\textcopyright} 1991 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

Each of these transitions has occurred many times in the history of bacterial-eukaryote symbiosis. We investigate these evolutionary events across the bacterial domain and also among a focal set of well studied bacterial mutualist lineages. Subsequently, we generate a framework for examining evolutionary transitions in bacterial symbiosis and test hypotheses about the selective, ecological, and genomic forces that shape these events.},

A proportional-rate, linear-biased, one-phase model emerges as the best model. A focal length toward which the mutational and/or substitutional process is linearly biased is a crucial feature of microsatellite evolution. We find that two-phase models do not lead to a significantly better fit than their one-phase counterparts. The performance of models based on the fit of their stationary distributions to the empirical distribution of microsatellite lengths in the human genome is consistent with that based on the human-chimp comparison. Microsatellites interrupted by even a single point mutation exhibit a twofold decrease in their mutation rate when compared to pure AC repeats. In general, models that allow chimps to have a larger per-repeat unit slippage rate and/or a shorter focal length compared to humans give a better fit to the human-chimp data as well as the human genomic data.},

	abstract = {Domestic cats have had a 10,000-year history of cohabitation with humans and seem to have the ability to communicate with humans. However, this has not been widely examined. We studied 20 domestic cats to investigate whether they could recognize their owners by using voices that called out the subjects' names, with a habituation-dishabituation method. While the owner was out of the cat's sight, we played three different strangers' voices serially, followed by the owner's voice. We recorded the cat's reactions to the voices and categorized them into six behavioral categories. In addition, ten naive raters rated the cats' response magnitudes. The cats responded to human voices not by communicative behavior (vocalization and tail movement), but by orienting behavior (ear movement and head movement). This tendency did not change even when they were called by their owners. Of the 20 cats, 15 demonstrated a lower response magnitude to the third voice than to the first voice. These habituated cats showed a significant rebound in response to the subsequent presentation of their owners' voices. This result indicates that cats are able to use vocal cues alone to distinguish between humans.},

	abstract = {Minimum spanning trees (MSTs) are frequently used in molecular epidemiology research to estimate relationships among individual strains or isolates. Nevertheless, there are significant caveats to MST algorithms that have been largely ignored in molecular epidemiology studies and that have the potential to confound or alter the interpretation of the results of those analyses. Specifically, (i) presenting a single, arbitrarily selected MST illustrates only one of potentially many equally optimal solutions, and (ii) statistical metrics are not used to assess the credibility of MST estimations. Here, we survey published MSTs previously used to infer microbial population structure in order to determine the effect of these factors. We propose a technique to estimate the number of alternative MSTs for a data set and find that multiple MSTs exist for each case in our survey. By implementing a bootstrapping metric to evaluate the reliability of alternative MST solutions, we discover that they encompass a wide range of credibility values. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that current approaches to studying population structure using MSTs are inadequate. We instead propose a systematic approach to MST estimation that bases analyses on the optimal computation of an input distance matrix, provides information about the number and configurations of alternative MSTs, and allows identification of the most credible MST or MSTs by using a bootstrapping metric. It is our hope this algorithm will become the new "gold standard" approach for analyzing MSTs for molecular epidemiology so that this generally useful computational approach can be used informatively and to its full potential.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evolution of parasite traits is inextricably linked to their hosts. For instance one common definition of parasite virulence is the reduction in host fitness due to infection. Thus, traits of infection must be viewed in both protagonists and may be under shared genetic and physiological control. We investigated these questions on the oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsis (= parasitica), a natural pathogen of the Brassicaceae Arabidopsis thaliana. RESULTS: We performed a controlled cross inoculation experiment confronting six lines of the host plant with seven strains of the parasite in order to evaluate genetic variation for phenotypic traits of infection among hosts, parasites, and distinct combinations. Parasite infection intensity and transmission were highly variable among parasite strains and host lines but depended also on the interaction between particular genotypes of the protagonists, and genetic variation for the infection phenotype of parasites from natural populations was found even at a small spatial scale within population. Furthermore, increased parasite fitness led to a significant decrease in host fitness only on a single host line (Gb), although a trade-off between these two traits was expected because host and parasite share the same resource pool for their respective reproduction. We propose that different levels of compatibility dependent on genotype by genotype interactions might lead to different amounts of resources available for host and parasite reproduction. This variation in compatibility could thus mask the expected negative relationship between host and parasite fitness, as the total resource pool would not be constant. CONCLUSION: These results highlight the importance of host variation in the determination of parasite fitness traits. This kind of interaction may in turn decouple the relationship between parasite transmission and its negative effect on host fitness, altering theoretical predictions of parasite evolution.},

A cross-infection experiment, using five lines of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana and two strains of its oomycete pathogen Hyaloperonospora parasitica, revealed that three traits traditionally considered those of the parasite (number of infected leaves, transmission success, and time until 50{\%} transmission), differed among specific combinations of host and parasite lines, being determined by the two protagonists of the infection. However, the two parasite strains did not differ significantly for most measured phenotypic traits of the infection.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pleistocene climatic oscillations have played a major role in structuring present-day biodiversity. The southern Mediterranean peninsulas have long been recognized as major glacial refugia, from where Northern Europe was post-glacially colonized. However, recent studies have unravelled numerous additional refugia also in northern regions. We investigated the phylogeographic pattern of the widespread Western Palaearctic lizard Podarcis muralis, using a range-wide multilocus approach, to evaluate whether it is concordant with a recent expansion from southern glacial refugia or alternatively from a combination of Mediterranean and northern refugia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We analyzed DNA sequences of two mitochondrial (cytb and nd4) and three nuclear (acm4, mc1r, and pdc) gene fragments in individuals from 52 localities across the species range, using phylogenetic and phylogeographic methods. The complex phylogeographic pattern observed, with 23 reciprocally monophyletic allo- parapatric lineages having a Pleistocene divergence, suggests a scenario of long-term isolation in multiple ice-age refugia across the species distribution range. Multiple lineages were identified within the three Mediterranean peninsulas - Iberia, Italy and the Balkans - where the highest genetic diversity was observed. Such an unprecedented phylogeographic pattern - here called "refugia within all refugia" - compasses the classical scenario of multiple southern refugia. However, unlike the southern refugia model, various distinct lineages were also found in northern regions, suggesting that additional refugia in France, Northern Italy, Eastern Alps and Central Balkans allowed the long-term persistence of this species throughout Pleistocene glaciations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The phylogeography of Podarcis muralis provides a paradigm of temperate species survival in Mediterranean and extra-Mediterranean glacial refugia. Such refugia acted as independent biogeographic compartments for the long-term persistence of this species, for the differentiation of its genetic lineages, and for the short-distance post-glacial re-colonization of neighbouring areas. This finding echoes previous findings from recent phylogeographic studies on species from temperate ecoregions, thus suggesting the need for a reappraisal of the role of northern refugia for glacial persistence and post-glacial assembly of Holarctic biota.},

	abstract = {Computer simulations were used to investigate the efficiency of management methods for the conservation of a structured population when local adaptation exists. A subdivided population, with subpopulations adapted to different optima for a quantitative trait under stabilizing selection, was managed in order to maintain the highest genetic diversity in a 10-generation period. Two procedures were compared. For the first, minimum coancestry contributions were carried out independently for each subpopulation, and random migration of individuals was accomplished thereafter. For the second, minimum coancestry contributions from individuals were globally implemented, including an optimal migration design. This optimal method can be adjusted to control local inbreeding to different extents. Adaptation to local optima implies a reduction in the efficiency of the management methods because of the effective failure in the established migrations. For strong selection, the optimal design can be very inefficient, even more than the random migration scheme because the intended migrants have usually low fitness in the recipient subpopulations. However, for more realistic moderate or weak selection, the optimal method is more efficient than random migration, especially if inbreeding depression on fitness is also taken into account. It is concluded that the optimal management method can be recommended in conservation programs with local adaptation of subpopulations, but this issue should be accounted for when designing the management strategies.},

However, many statistical methods routinely used to test temporal changes in allele frequencies fail to establish a proper hypothesis or have theoretical or practical limitations. Here, a Bayesian statistical test is proposed in which the distribution of the distances among sampling frequencies is approached with computer simulations, and hypergeometric sampling is considered instead of binomial sampling. To validate the test and compare its performance with other tests, agent-based model simulations were run for a variety of scenarios, and two real molecular databases were analysed. The results showed that the simulation test (ST) maintained the significance value used ($\alpha$=0{\textperiodcentered}05) for a vast combination of parameter values, whereas other tests were sensitive to the effect of genetic drift or binomial sampling. The differences between binomial and hypergeometric sampling were more complex than expected, and a novel effect was described. This study suggests that the ST is especially useful for studies with small populations and many alleles, as in microsatellite or sequencing molecular data.},

	abstract = {Predation by exotic species has caused the extinction of many native animal species on islands, whereas competition from exotic plants has caused few native plant extinctions. Exotic plant addition to islands is highly nonrandom, with an almost perfect 1 to 1 match between the number of naturalized and native plant species on oceanic islands. Here, we evaluate several alternative implications of these findings. Does the consistency of increase in plant richness across islands imply that a saturation point in species richness has been reached? If not, should we expect total plant richness to continue to increase as new species are added? Finally, is the rarity of native plant extinctions to date a misleading measure of the impact of past invasions, one that hides an extinction debt that will be paid in the future? By analyzing historical records, we show that the number of naturalized plant species has increased linearly over time on many individual islands. Further, the mean ratio of naturalized to native plant species across islands has changed steadily for nearly two centuries. These patterns suggest that many more species will become naturalized on islands in the future. We also discuss how dynamics of invasion bear upon alternative saturation scenarios and the implications these scenarios have for the future retention or extinction of native plant species. Finally, we identify invasion-motivated research gaps (propagule pressure, time-lags to extinction, abundance shifts, and loss of area) that can aid in forecasting extinction and in developing a more comprehensive theory of species extinctions.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Europe is characterised by several high mountain systems dominating major parts of its area, and these structures have strongly influenced the evolution of taxa. For species now restricted to these high mountain systems, characteristic biogeographical patterns of differentiation exist. (i) Many local endemics are found in most of the European high mountain systems especially in the Alps and the more geographically peripheral regions of Europe. Populations isolated in these peripheral mountain ranges often have strongly differentiated endemic genetic lineages, which survived and evolved in the vicinity of these mountain areas over long time periods. (ii) Populations of taxa with wide distributions in the Alps often have two or more genetic lineages, which in some cases even have the status of cryptic species. In many cases, these lineages are the results of several centres of glacial survival in the perialpine areas. Similar patterns also apply to the other geographically extended European high mountain systems, especially the Pyrenees and Carpathians. (iii) Populations from adjoining high mountain systems often show similar genetic lineages, a phenomenon best explained by postglacial retreat to these mountains from one single differentiation centre between them. (iv) The populations of a number of species show gradients of genetic diversity from a genetically richer East to a poorer West.

	abstract = {The climatic cycles with subsequent glacial and intergalcial periods have had a great impact on the distribution and evolution of species. Using genetic analytical tools considerably increased our understanding of these processes. In this review I therefore give an overview of the molecular biogeography of Europe. For means of simplification, I distinguish between three major biogeographical entities: (i) "Mediterranean" with Mediterranean differentiation and dispersal centres, (ii) "Continental" with extra-Mediterranean centres and (iii) "Alpine" and/or "Arctic" with recent alpine and/or arctic distribution patterns. These different molecular biogeographical patterns are presented using actual examples. Many "Mediterranean" species are differentiated into three major European genetic lineages, which are due to glacial isolation in the three major Mediterranean peninsulas. Postglacial expansion in this group of species is mostly influenced by the barriers of the Pyrenees and the Alps with four resulting main patterns of postglacial range expansions. However, some cases are known with less than one genetic lineage per Mediterranean peninsula on the one hand, and others with a considerable genetic substructure within each of the Mediterranean peninsulas, Asia Minor and the Maghreb. These structures within the Mediterranean sub-centres are often rather strong and in several cases even predate the Pleistocene. For the "Continental" species, it could be shown that the formerly supposed postglacial spread from eastern Palearctic expansion centres is mostly not applicable. Quite the contrary, most of these species apparently had extra-Mediterranean centres of survival in Europe with special importance of the perialpine regions, the Carpathian Basin and parts of the Balkan Peninsula. In the group of "Alpine" and/or "Arctic" species, several molecular biogeographical patterns have been found, which support and improve the postulates based on distribution patterns and pollen records. Thus, genetic studies support the strong linkage between southwestern Alps and Pyrenees, northeastern Alps and Carpathians as well as southeastern Alps and the Dinaric mountain systems, hereby allowing conclusions on the glacial distribution patterns of these species. Furthermore, genetic analyses of arctic-alpine disjunct species support their broad distribution in the periglacial areas at least during the last glacial period. The detailed understanding of the different phylogeographical structures is essential for the management of the different evolutionary significant units of species and the conservation of their entire genetic diversity. Furthermore, the distribution of genetic diversity due to biogeographical reasons helps understanding the differing regional vulnerabilities of extant populations.},

	abstract = {Isolation of Mediterranean species in the southern European peninsulas during the cold glacial phases often resulted in differentiation of several genetic lineages confined to the respective peninsulas. However, whilst there is good genetic evidence for multiple refugia in Iberia, there are only limited data available for the Balkans. Therefore, we wish to examine the hypothesis of a strong genetic structuring within southeastern Europe for the existence of multiple Balkan differentiation centres and/or several leading edges. As a model we use the marbled white butterfly, Melanargia galathea. We studied 18 allozyme loci of 564 individuals from 16 populations distributed over a large part of southeastern Europe. The single populations showed moderately high genetic diversity and no northward decline of genetic diversity was detected. The overall genetic differentiation between populations was considerable (F(ST) 7.0{\%}). Cluster analysis discriminated three genetic groups: (i) a western flank in the former Yugoslavia, parts of eastern Austria and Hungary; (ii) an eastern flank with populations from Bulgaria and Romania (south of the southern Carpathians and eastern Carpathians); and (iii) the eastern Carpathian Basin. Hierarchical variance analysis distributed 53{\%} of the variance among populations between these three groups. One sample from the Greek-Bulgarian border clustered within the eastern flank, but showed some tendency towards the eastern Carpathian Basin populations. Two populations from Carinthia clustered together with the eastern Carpathian Basin ones and a population from Styria showed an intermediate genetic composition between the three groups. Most probably, the eastern and the western flank groups are due to postglacial range expansion from the northeastern and the northwestern edges of the glacial differentiation centre (so-called leading edges). The eastern Carpathian Basin group may have resulted from postglacial expansion from northern Greece through valley systems of the central Balkan peninsula, maybe even expanding westwards north of the Balkan mountains reaching some parts of eastern Austria (e.g. Carinthia). Therefore, the Balkanic refugium of M. galathea may or may not have been continuous along the coastal areas of the Mediterranean, but must have been strongly genetically structured.},

	abstract = {Phylogeographical studies are available for a considerable number of European species, but few analyses exist for temperate species with very large and fairly continuous populations that are also absent from Northern Europe. Therefore, we studied the butterfly Maniola jurtina as a model for this group. The species has two major genetic lineages (mean genetic distance between lineages: 0.033; FCT: 0.052), most probably evolving in glacial differentiation centres in the western and eastern Mediterranean. The onset of this differentiation might have been the beginning of the last glacial stage maximum some 40 kyr BP. A hybrid zone between these two lineages exists in western Central Europe. No genetic substructures have been found within the two lineages (FSC: 0.017) and average genetic distances are very small. Therefore, it is highly probable that postglacial expansion was of the phalanx type. There is, at most, very limited differentiation at regional and local scales. However, the genetic diversity within populations is high (means: A: 2.68;HE: 17.2{\%};P: 78{\%}), as would be predicted for such a common species. Comparison of these results with a published allozyme analysis revealed a similar phylogeographical pattern, but lower genetic diversity in the latter. Morphological patterns of wings and genitalia show similar geographical patterns as allozyme data.},

	abstract = {The threatened Bluetail Mole Skink (Plestiodon egregius lividus) is limited to the xeric habitats of the southern Lake Wales Ridge in central Florida. To generate important data for conserving this species, we characterized genetic variation at the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene and seven microsatellite loci among multiple populations. We compared the Bluetail Mole Skink's pattern of genetic diversity and differentiation to those of two other lizards with similar geographic and habitat distributions the Florida Sand Skink (Plestiodon reynoldsi) and the Florida Scrub Lizard (Sceloporus woodi). The Bluetail Mole Skink was highly variable at the genetic markers, and significant genetic differentiation occurred among scrub patches. Patches can be divided into central and southern Lake Wales Ridge groups. Our results also suggest that each sampled habitat patch should be treated as a population and reintroductions should minimize the distance between recipient and source locations to limit altering the potential long-term pattern of genetic differentiation among Bluetail Mole Skinks on the Lake Wales Ridge. The Bluetail Mole Skink and the Florida Sand Skink had similar genetic diversity, and all three lizards had comparable patterns of genetic differentiation. The concordance of genetic differentiation among these species is further evidence suggesting that similar conservation issues face the three species, namely, preserving the remaining xeric habitat. It is likely, therefore, that conservation efforts directed at the more common Florida Sand Skink and Florida Scrub Lizard would benefit the Bluetail Mole Skink.},

@article{Schwartz2009,
	abstract = {Abstract  There has been a recent trend in genetic studies of wild populations where researchers have changed their sampling schemes from sampling pre-defined populations to sampling individuals uniformly across landscapes. This reflects the fact that many species under study are continuously distributed rather than clumped into obvious ``populations''. Once individual samples are collected, many landscape genetic studies use clustering algorithms and multilocus genetic data to group samples into subpopulations. After clusters are derived, landscape features that may be acting as barriers are examined and described. In theory, if populations were evenly sampled, this course of action should reliably identify population structure. However, genetic gradients and irregularly collected samples may impact the composition and location of clusters. We built genetic models where individual genotypes were either randomly distributed across a landscape or contained gradients created by neighbor mating for multiple generations. We investigated the influence of six different sampling protocols on population clustering using program STRUCTURE, the most commonly used model-based clustering method for multilocus genotype data. For models where individuals (and their alleles) were randomly distributed across a landscape, STRUCTURE correctly predicted that only one population was being sampled. However, when gradients created by neighbor mating existed, STRUCTURE detected multiple, but different numbers of clusters, depending on sampling protocols. We recommend testing for fine scale autocorrelation patterns prior to sample clustering, as the scale of the autocorrelation appears to influence the results. Further, we recommend that researchers pay attention to the impacts that sampling may have on subsequent population and landscape genetic results.},

	abstract = {The Jamaican iguana (Cyclura collei) was considered to be extinct until its rediscovery in 1990 in the Hellshire Hills region of Jamaica. Between 1994 and 1996, several wild caught juveniles were placed in six North American zoological institutions including the Indianapolis Zoo. The intent was to establish a self-sustaining captive population outside of Jamaica in order to serve as an ancillary population should the wild numbers decline. Several environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, photoperiod and diet were manipulated to encourage reproduction in captivity. In 2006, two clutches of eggs were deposited by two separate females for a total of 35 eggs. Twenty-six eggs were fertile and 22 hatched after a 76-83-day incubation at 30.3-30.8 degrees C (86.5-86.7 degrees F). The average weight of the neonates was 26.4 g and the average total length was 21.7 cm. This successful reproduction of C. collei constitutes the first North American hatching for this species. Environmental parameters, incubation techniques and neonate morphometry can serve as a baseline for further propagation of the species. This represents a positive milestone for the continuing conservation of this critically endangered species.},

Reproductive isolation theories predict a loss of genetic diversity and increases in inbreeding and spatial genetic structure (SGS) in such populations. We analysed eight microsatellite loci to investigate the pollen and seed dispersal patterns, genetic diversity, inbreeding and SGS of the tropical tree Copaifera langsdorffii in a small (4.8 ha), isolated population. All 112 adult trees and 128 seedlings found in the stand were sampled, mapped and genotyped. Seedlings had significantly lower levels of genetic diversity (A=16.5$\pm$0.45, mean$\pm$95{\%} s.e.; H(e)=0.838$\pm$0.006) than did adult trees (A=23.2$\pm$0.81; H(e)=0.893$\pm$0.030). Parentage analysis did not indicate any seed immigration (m(seeds)=0) and the pollen immigration rate was very low (m(pollen)=0.047). The average distance of realized pollen dispersal within the stand was 94 m, with 81{\%} of the pollen travelling {\textless}150 m. A significant negative correlation was found between the frequency and distance of pollen dispersal (r=-0.79, P{\textless}0.01), indicating that short-distance pollinations were more frequent. A significant SGS for both adults (∼50 m) and seedlings (∼20 m) was also found, indicating that most of the seeds were dispersed over short distances. The results suggested that the spatial isolation of populations by habitat fragmentation can restrict seed and pollen gene flow, increase SGS and affect the genetic diversity of future generations.},

	abstract = {Recent improvements in genetic analysis and genotyping methods have resulted in a rapid expansion of the power of molecular markers to address ecological questions. Microsatellites have emerged as the most popular and versatile marker type for ecological applications. The rise of commercial services that can isolate microsatellites for new study species and genotype samples at reasonable prices presents ecologists with the unprecedented ability to employ genetic approaches without heavy investment in specialized equipment. Nevertheless, the lack of accessible, synthesized information on the practicalities and pitfalls of using genetic tools impedes ecologists' ability to make informed decisions on using molecular approaches and creates the risk that some will use microsatellites without understanding the steps needed to evaluate the quality of a genetic data set. The first goal of this synthesis is to provide an overview of the strengths and limitations of microsatellite markers and the risks, cost and time requirements of isolating and using microsatellites with the aid of commercial services. The second goal is to encourage the use and consistent reporting of thorough marker screening to ensure high quality data. To that end, we present a multistep screening process to evaluate candidate loci for inclusion in a genetic study that is broadly targeted to both novice and experienced geneticists alike.},

We compare the performance of our method to that of widely used commercial kits across a range of soil, stool, tissue and water samples. Mu-DNA produced DNA extractions of similar or higher yield and purity to that of the commercial kits. As a proof of principle, we carried out replicate fish metabarcoding of aquatic eDNA extractions, which confirmed that the species detection efficiency of our method is similar to that of the most frequently used commercial kit. Our results demonstrate the reliability of Mu-DNA along with its modular adaptability to challenging sample types and sample collection methods.

	abstract = {Using a primate animal model, two studies were undertaken to examine the effects of cigarette smoking on thyroid hormone levels. In study 1, mean total triiodothyronine (total T3) and mean total thyroxine (total T4) levels were measured in two groups of baboons (Papio cynocephalus) who were taught to smoke cigarettes using operant conditioning techniques. The smokers were divided into established and naive smokers according to pack-years of exposure. A control group of never-smoker baboons was included for comparison. Blood sampling was done after long-term cigarette consumption and again 1 week after cigarette deprivation. In the naive smoker group, mean total T3 concentrations were reduced below control group values (P less than 0.05). After cigarette deprivation for 1 week, mean total T3 values returned to normal. No significant differences in total T4 levels were observed in either group. In study 2, we assessed some other indices of thyroid function. The same groups of baboons were divided into good and poor smokers by plasma cotinine and blood carboxyhemoglobin ({\%} COHb) levels during 28 weeks of cigarette smoking activity. Immediate fluctuations and reductions in total T3 levels were observed that were not accompanied by reductions in total T4. The animals were then cigarette deprived for 1 week and blood samples were obtained every other day during this period. Significant increases in total T3 concentrations were observed in poor smokers immediately after cessation. Both groups also exhibited significant reductions (P less than 0.05) in T3 uptake and free T4 index (FT4I) when compared to control group values. These data suggest that poor smokers are more susceptible to thyroid hormone level shifts than more established smokers, since the established smokers become habituated to the compounds contained in cigarette smoke through repeated exposure.},

Here I consider two additional forces that may play a substantial role in the adaptive evolution of premating isolation, direct selection on preferences and indirect selection against postmating, prezygotic incompatibilities. First, I argue that a combination of ecological character displacement and sensory bias can cause direct selection on preferences that results in the pattern of reproductive character displacement. Both analytical and numerical methods are then used to demonstrate that, as expected from work in single populations, such direct selection will easily overwhelm indirect selection due to low hybrid fitness as the primary determinant of preference evolution. Second, postmating, prezygotic incompatibilities are presented as a driving force in the evolution of premating isolation. Two classes of these mechanisms, those increasing female mortality after mating but before producing offspring and those reducing female fertility, are shown to be identical in their effects on preference divergence. Analytical and numerical techniques are then used to demonstrate that postmating, prezygotic factors may place strong selection on preference divergence. These selective forces are shown to be comparable if not greater than those produced by the low fitness of hybrids.},

All loci and populations were highly polymorphic. Our analyses also detected considerable genetic structure within and among the sampled localities, and revealed ancestral gene flow of E. blandingii in this region north and east from an ancient refugium in the central Great Plains, concordant with post-glacial recolonization timescales.

Interspecific variation in microsatellite stability also provides a glimpse into aspects of phylogenetic constancy of mutational processes. Using long-term series of mutation-accumulation lines, we have obtained direct estimates of the spectrum of microsatellite mutations in two model systems: the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the microcrustacean Daphnia pulex. Although the scaling of the mutation rate with the number of tandem repeats is highly consistent across distantly related species, including yeast and human, the per-cell-division mutation rate appears to be elevated in multicellular species. Contrary to the expectations under the stepwise mutation model, most microsatellite mutations in C. elegans and D. pulex involve changes of multiple repeat units, with expansions being much more common than contractions.},

	abstract = {Previous genetic studies have demonstrated that natal homing shapes the stock structure of marine turtle nesting populations. However, widespread sharing of common haplotypes based on short segments of the mitochondrial control region often limits resolution of the demographic connectivity of populations. Recent studies employing longer control region sequences to resolve haplotype sharing have focused on regional assessments of genetic structure and phylogeography. Here we synthesize available control region sequences for loggerhead turtles from the Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic, and western Indian Ocean basins. These data represent six of the nine globally significant regional management units (RMUs) for the species and include novel sequence data from Brazil, Cape Verde, South Africa and Oman. Genetic tests of differentiation among 42 rookeries represented by short sequences (380 bp haplotypes from 3,486 samples) and 40 rookeries represented by long sequences (∼800 bp haplotypes from 3,434 samples) supported the distinction of the six RMUs analyzed as well as recognition of at least 18 demographically independent management units (MUs) with respect to female natal homing. A total of 59 haplotypes were resolved. These haplotypes belonged to two highly divergent global lineages, with haplogroup I represented primarily by CC-A1, CC-A4, and CC-A11 variants and haplogroup II represented by CC-A2 and derived variants. Geographic distribution patterns of haplogroup II haplotypes and the nested position of CC-A11.6 from Oman among the Atlantic haplotypes invoke recent colonization of the Indian Ocean from the Atlantic for both global lineages. The haplotypes we confirmed for western Indian Ocean RMUs allow reinterpretation of previous mixed stock analysis and further suggest that contemporary migratory connectivity between the Indian and Atlantic Oceans occurs on a broader scale than previously hypothesized. This study represents a valuable model for conducting comprehensive international cooperative data management and research in marine ecology.},

@article{Shannon1948,
	abstract = {The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication. A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. If the number of messages in the set is finite then this number or any monotonic function of this number can be regarded as a measure of the information produced when one message is chosen from the set, all choices being equally likely. As was pointed out by Hartley the most natural choice is the logarithmic function. Although this definition must be generalized considerably when we consider the influence of the statistics of the message and when we have a continuous range of messages, we will in all cases use an essentially logarithmic measure.},

@article{Shelton2013,
	abstract = {Understanding the temporal variability in vital rates (e.g. growth and survivorship) of wild populations is practically and statistically difficult but crucial for connecting such variation to mechanistic drivers and their population consequences. For somatic growth, empirical estimates of variation are rare because they often require expensive long-term tag-recapture programs. In marine pelagic ecosystems, where many species are difficult to sample and not amenable to tag- ging studies, researchers have relied on estimating growth from length-frequency distributions. We developed a general approach for estimating growth from observed length-frequency samples by combining kernel density estimates of the length-frequency distribution and the von Berta- lanffy growth function. Our approach is conceptually straightforward and easy to implement. We applied the methods to Antarctic krill Euphausia superba collected from the Southern Ocean over a span of 19 yr to document among-year variation in krill growth during the austral summer. Our estimates of growth align closely with existing estimates of growth, but we provide the first esti- mates of among-year variation in krill growth. We estimate very high among-year variation in growth (annual estimates for a 30 mm krill in the Elephant Island region ranged from 0.00 to 0.17 mm d−1; mean = 0.073, among-year coefficient of variation ≈ 0.8). We correlated growth rate variation to estimates of ocean chlorophyll but not to other oceanographic indices, contrasting with results from previous studies. The large amount of variation in growth unexplained by envi- ronmental covariates has substantial implications for ecosystem management in the Southern Ocean ecosystem. KEY},

	abstract = {When choosing between two potential mates, a male may benefit by picking a larger (longer and/or more heavy-bodied) female because she is likely to produce more or larger offspring. Males of many species use visual cues to evaluate the sizes of their mates, but in some situations (at night or in a crowded mating swarm), vision may be useless. Potentially, males may be able to use chemical cues that convey information about female body size. We manipulated cues available to free-ranging male garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis) in large courting aggregations near communal dens in Manitoba, Canada. Males not only directed disproportionate courtship to longer and heavier-bodied females, but also courted most vigorously in response to lipids extracted from the skins of such females. Our data show that with a flick of his tongue, a male garter snake can identify not only a female's body length, but also her body condition.},

	abstract = {Two consequences of terrestrial ectothermy (low energy needs and behavioral control of body temperatures) have had major consequences for the evolution of reptile life-history traits. For example, reproducing females can manipulate incubation temperatures and thus phenotypic traits of their offspring by retaining developing eggs in utero. This ability has resulted in multiple evolutionary transitions from oviparity to viviparity in cool-climate reptile populations. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of operative temperatures in terrestrial habitats also has favored careful nest-site selection and a matching of embryonic reaction norms to thermal regimes during incubation (e.g., via temperature-dependent sex determination). Many of the life-history features in which reptiles differ from endothermic vertebrates-such as their small offspring sizes, large litter sizes, and infrequent reproduction-are direct consequences of ectothermy, reflecting freedom from heat-conserving constraints on body size and energy storage. Ectothermy confers immense flexibility, enabling a dynamic matching of life-history traits to local circumstances. This flexibility has generated massive spatial and temporal variation in life-history traits via phenotypic plasticity as well as adaptation. The diversity of life histories in reptiles can best be interpreted within a conceptual framework that views reptiles as low-energy, variable-temperature systems.},

	abstract = {Advances in tracking technology have led to an exponential increase in animal location data, greatly enhancing our ability to address interesting questions in movement ecology, but also presenting new challenges related to data management and analysis. Step-selection functions (SSFs) are commonly used to link environmental covariates to animal location data collected at fine temporal resolution. SSFs are estimated by comparing observed steps connecting successive animal locations to random steps, using a likelihood equivalent of a Cox proportional hazards model. By using common statistical distributions to model step length and turn angle distributions, and including habitat- and movement-related covariates (functions of distances between points, angular deviations), it is possible to make inference regarding habitat selection and movement processes or to control one process while investigating the other. The fitted model can also be used to estimate utilization distributions and mechanistic home ranges. Here, we present the R package amt (animal movement tools) that allows users to fit SSFs to data and to simulate space use of animals from fitted models. The amt package also provides tools for managing telemetry data. Using fisher (Pekania pennanti) data as a case study, we illustrate a four-step approach to the analysis of animal movement data, consisting of data management, exploratory data analysis, fitting of models, and simulating from fitted models.},

	abstract = {Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is a requirement for malignant tumor growth and metastasis. In the absence of angiogenesis, local tumor expansion is suppressed at a few millimeters and cells lack routes for distant hematogenous spread. Clinical studies have demonstrated that the degree of angiogenesis is correlated with the malignant potential of several cancers, including breast cancer and malignant melanoma. Moreover, the expression of a specific angiogenesis marker, the endothelial integrin alphaVbeta3, has been shown to correlate with tumor grade. However, studies of tumor angiogenesis such as these have generally relied on invasive procedures, adequate tissue sampling and meticulous estimation of histologic microvessel density. In the present report, we describe a novel approach to detecting angiogenesis in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a paramagnetic contrast agent targeted to endothelial alphaVbeta3 via the LM609 monoclonal antibody. This approach provided enhanced and detailed imaging of rabbit carcinomas by directly targeting paramagnetic agents to the angiogenic vasculature. In addition, angiogenic 'hot spots' not seen by standard MRI were detected. Our strategy for MR imaging of alphaVbeta3 thus represents a non-invasive means to assess the growth and malignant phenotype of tumors.},

A value of epsilon(ox.) (410)=282x10(3) litre.mol(-1).cm(-1) was calculated for a dimeric protein molecule having a total molecular weight of 122000 (based on iron analysis). Steady-state kinetic observations of the enzyme-catalysed oxidation of reduced azurin by nitrite indicated a marked increase in enzyme inactivation as the pH was raised from 5.7 to 7.2. Since NO, a product of the nitrite reductase activity of Pseudomonas cytochrome oxidase, is known to bind to the enzyme, a study was undertaken to try to assess the potential of NO as a product inhibitor. Investigations showed that samples of the oxidized protein at pH values 4, 5 and 6 bound NO to both haem c and d(1) components, but oxidized enzyme samples at pH7 and above formed their reduced ligand-bound forms when placed under an atmosphere of the gas. Ascorbate-reduced enzyme samples at pH4, 5, 6 and 7 were also found to bind NO at both haem components, although at pH7 the rate of haem c binding was very slow. At pH8 and 9 only the ferrohaem d(1) bound NO. Titration experiments on the reduced protein over the pH range 5-7, with nitrite as a precursor of NO, showed that the haem d(1) had a much higher affinity than the haem c: experiments at pH5.2 and 5.9 with NO-equilibrated solutions revealed the same pattern of behaviour with the oxidized enzyme.},

	abstract = {The gene coding for nitrite reductase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been cloned and its sequence determined. The coding region is 1707 bp long and contains information for a polypeptide chain of 568 amino acids. The sequence of the mature protein has been confirmed independently by extensive amino acid sequencing. The amino-terminus of the mature protein is located at Lys-26; the preceding 25 residue long extension shows the features typical of signal peptides. Therefore the enzyme is probably secreted into the periplasmic space. The mature protein is made of 543 amino acid residues and has a molecular mass of 60204 Da. The c-heme-binding domain, which contains the only two Cys of the molecule, is located at the amino-terminal region. Analysis of the protein sequence in terms of hydrophobicity profile gives results consistent with the fact that the enzyme is fully water soluble and not membrane bound; the most hydrophilic region appears to correspond to the c-heme domain. Secondary structure predictions are in general agreement with previous analysis of circular dichroic data. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

	abstract = {After three centuries of anthropogenic insults, island species and communities are in the forefront of the precipitous decline in biodiversity that we face in the new millennium. The sorry plight of island biotas is often seen as resulting from an inherent weakness of island species, manifested particularly by how poorly they have fared in response to the many continental species introduced to islands. In fact, particular continental populations and communities have been similarly devastated. However, their larger geographic ranges tend to immunize them against the global extinction suffered by island species, many of which are endemic. The problems for island species are more those of restricted range than of minimum viable population size. Neither are the solutions to this insular hecatomb to be found in generalized attempts to avoid small populations. Rather, management must be tailored to the idiosyncrasies of particular threatened species and communities. The two key actions that would improve the prospects for many island biotas would be a lessening of the rate of introduction of nonindigenous species and a decline in the rate of habitat conversion. Prospects for activities to stem the impact of invasions are improving, though still not good. There seems little reason for optimism about lessening island habitat destruction, but improvements can be made in excluding potentially harmful species introductions, eradicating introduced species that nevertheless establish populations, and enhancing the ranges of very restricted island species through transplantation. Crucial to three efforts is a sound understanding of the natural history of island species.},

How these demographic events have affected the burden of deleterious mutations in individuals and the frequencies of disease mutations in populations remains unclear. We use population genetic models to show that recent human demography has probably had little impact on the average burden of deleterious mutations. This prediction is supported by two exome sequence data sets showing that individuals of west African and European ancestry carry very similar burdens of damaging mutations. We further show that for many diseases, rare alleles are unlikely to contribute a large fraction of the heritable variation, and therefore the impact of recent growth is likely to be modest. However, for those diseases that have a direct impact on fitness, strongly deleterious rare mutations probably do have an important role, and recent growth will have increased their impact.},

	abstract = {THE `characteristic' defined by Yule1 and the `index of diversity' defined by Fisher2 are two measures of the degree of concentration or diversity achieved when the individuals of a population are classified into groups. Both are defined as statistics to be calculated from sample data and not in terms of population constants. The index of diversity has so far been used chiefly with the logarithmic distribution.

However, sequencing costs often set limits to the amount of sequences that can be generated and, consequently, the biological outcomes that can be achieved from an experimental design. In this Review, we discuss the issue of sequencing depth in the design of next-generation sequencing experiments. We review current guidelines and precedents on the issue of coverage, as well as their underlying considerations, for four major study designs, which include de novo genome sequencing, genome resequencing, transcriptome sequencing and genomic location analyses (for example, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and chromosome conformation capture (3C)).},

	abstract = {The mechanistic bases of natural and sexual selection on physiological and behavioral traits were examined in male morphs of three colors of the side-blotched lizard, Uta stansburiana. Orange-throated males are aggressive and defend large territories with many females. Blue-throated males defend smaller territories with fewer females; however, blue-throated males assiduously mate guard females on their territory. Yellow-throated males do not defend a territory, but patrol a large home range. They obtain secretive copulations from females on the territories of dominant males. Males with bright orange throats had higher levels of plasma testosterone (T), endurance, activity, and home range size and concomitantly gained greater control over female home ranges than blue- or yellow-throated males. Experimentally elevating plasma T in yellow- and blue-throated males increased their endurance, activity, home range size, and control over female territories to levels that were seen in unmanipulated orange-throated males that had naturally high plasma T. However, the enhanced performance of orange-throated males is not without costs. Orange-throated males had low survival compared to the other morphs. Finally, some yellow-throated males transformed to a partial blue morphology late in the season and the endurance of these transforming yellow-throated males increased from early to late in the season. In addition, yellow-throated males that transformed to blue also had significantly higher plasma T late in the season compared to the plasma T earlier in the season. T appears to play an important role in the physiological changes that all three color morphs undergo during the process of maturation. In some yellow males, T plays an additional role in plastic changes in behavior and physiology late in the reproductive season. We discuss natural and sexual selection on physiological and behavioral traits that leads to the evolution of steroid regulation in the context of alternative male strategies.},

	abstract = {Geneticists have been interested in inbreeding and inbreeding depression since the time of Darwin. Two alternative approaches that can be used to measure how inbred an individual is involve the use of pedigree records to estimate inbreeding coefficients or molecular markers to measure multilocus heterozygosity. However, the relationship between inbreeding coefficient and heterozygosity has only rarely been investigated. In this paper, a framework to predict the relationship between the two variables is presented. In addition, microsatellite genotypes at 138 loci spanning all 26 autosomes of the sheep genome were used to investigate the relationship between inbreeding coefficient and multilocus heterozygosity. Multilocus heterozygosity was only weakly correlated with inbreeding coefficient, and heterozygosity was not positively correlated between markers more often than expected by chance. Inbreeding coefficient, but not multilocus heterozygosity, detected evidence of inbreeding depression for morphological traits. The relevance of these findings to the causes of heterozygosity--fitness correlations is discussed and predictions for other wild and captive populations are presented.},

@article{Slatkin1987,
	abstract = {There is abundant geographic variation in both morphology and gene frequency in most species. The extent of geographic variation results from a balance of forces tending to produce local genetic differentiation and forces tending to produce genetic homogeneity. Mutation, genetic drift due to finite population size, and natural selection favoring adaptations to local environmental conditions will all lead to the genetic differentiation of local populations, and the movement of gametes, individuals, and even entire populations--collectively called gene flow--will oppose that differentiation. Gene flow may either constrain evolution by preventing adaptation to local conditions or promote evolution by spreading new genes and combinations of genes throughout a species' range. Several methods are available for estimating the amount of gene flow. Direct methods monitor ongoing gene flow, and indirect methods use spatial distributions of gene frequencies to infer past gene flow. Applications of these methods show that species differ widely in the gene flow that they experience. Of particular interest are those species for which direct methods indicate little current gene flow but indirect methods indicate much higher levels of gene flow in the recent past. Such species probably have undergone large-scale demographic changes relatively frequently.},

@article{Sly2011,
	abstract = {With its large size, complex topography and high number of avian endemics, Hispaniola appears to be a likely candidate for the in situ speciation of its avifauna, despite the worldwide rarity of avian speciation within single islands. We used multilocus comparative phylogeography techniques to examine the pattern and history of divergence in 11 endemic birds representing potential within-island speciation events. Haplotype and allele networks from mitochondrial ND2 and nuclear intron loci reveal a consistent pattern: phylogeographic divergence within or between closely related species is correlated with the likely distribution of ancient sea barriers that once divided Hispaniola into several smaller paleo-islands. Coalescent and mitochondrial clock dating of divergences indicate species-specific response to different geological events over the wide span of the island's history. We found no evidence that ecological or topographical complexity generated diversity, either by creating open niches or by restricting long-term gene flow. Thus, no true within-island speciation appears to have occurred among the species sampled on Hispaniola. Divergence events predating the merging of Hispaniola's paleo-island blocks cannot be considered in situ divergence, and postmerging divergence in response to episodic island segmentation by marine flooding probably represents in situ vicariance or interarchipelago speciation by dispersal. Our work highlights the necessity of considering island geologic history while investigating the speciation-area relationship in birds and other taxa.},

The sex ratios of both populations changed from strongly male-biased early in the study to nearly 1:1 in recent years.

Some species (e.g., Salmonella) were found to be clonal at all levels of analysis. At the other extreme, Neisseria gonorrhoeae is panmictic, with random association between loci. Two intermediate types of population structure were also found. Neisseria meningitidis displays what we have called an "epidemic" structure. There is significant association between loci, but this arises only because of the recent, explosive, increase in particular electrophoretic types; when this effect is eliminated the population is found to be effectively panmictic. In contrast, linkage disequilibrium in a population of Rhizobium meliloti exists because the sample consisted of two genetically isolated divisions, often fixed for different alleles: within each division association between loci was almost random. The method of analysis is appropriate whenever there is doubt about the extent of genetic recombination between members of a population. To illustrate this we analyzed data on protozoan parasites and again found panmictic, epidemic, and clonal population structures},

	abstract = {The historical biogeography of the lizard clade Iguanidae is complicated. In addition to difficulties within the New World, where most of the more than 900 living species are found, two extant iguanid clades, Brachylophus and Oplurinae, occur well outside it. Moreover, there is a small set of Eocene species in Europe, most notably those placed in the genus Geiseltaliellus. To examine the relevance of Geiseltaliellus to iguanid biogeography, I redescribe several well-preserved specimens (nearly complete skeletons with epidermal scales) from the middle Eocene lake deposits of Messel, Germany. These specimens were previously referred to the type species, G. longicaudus, but comparison with the type material reveals differences that warrant specific distinction. Messel Geiseltaliellus resembles extant Basiliscus in squamation and parietal growth. Phylogenetic analysis of morphological data using Bayesian and parsimony methods suggests the following about the evolution of pleurodont iguanians: (1) Iguanidae is monophyletic, its members united by unique features of the snout; (2) Iguanidae is divided into two major clades, one consisting of Polychrotinae* + Corytophaninae, Iguaninae + Hoplocercinae and Crotaphytinae (Clade A), the other of Phrynosomatinae, Tropidurinae* and Oplurinae (Clade B); (3) Polychrotinae* and Corytophaninae are sister taxa; and (4) Geiseltaliellus is on the stem of Corytophaninae. The presence of Geiseltaliellus in Europe during the warm, humid Eocene suggests dispersal from North America and a more northerly distribution of the corytophanine stem than the crown. Geiseltaliellus represents a separate invasion by Iguanidae of the Old World and an evolutionary dead end. On the basis of its fossil record and modern distribution, Clade A is interpreted as ancestrally North American. Persistent conflict of morphological with molecular genetic data on iguanid relationships remains to be resolved.},

	abstract = {A phylogenetic scheme derived via multivariate analyses of adaptively neutral scale characteristics is compared to patterns of ecological adaptation in body size and shape, hatchling size, clutch size, and reproductive seasonality, in extant populations of Galapagos land iguanas (genus Conolophus). Three groups of land iguana populations are identified, the oldest being the population of Isla Santa Fe, followed by the populations of the central islands (Santa Cruz, Plaza Sur and Baltra), the youngest populations are those of the western islands (Fernandina and Isabela). Patterns of ecological similarity among these populations are not concordant with phylogenetic lineage. Populations most similar in ecological characteristics are often phylogenetically divergent. Adaptation to local conditions by iguana populations is apparently more important than phylogenetic constraint in explaining variation in ecological characteristics. The assumption that phylogenetically closely‐related organisms are also ecologically more similar than less closely‐related organisms is not supported by this evidence. Some previous studies may have been misled by using ecological characteristics to derive phylogenetic lineages, resulting in circular support of the assumption.

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Mutation-accumulation experiments have been used to study this process in a wide variety of organisms, yet the exact mutational underpinnings of genetic loads and their fitness consequences remain poorly characterized. Here, we use an abiotic system of RNA populations evolving continuously in vitro to examine the molecular events that can instigate a genetic load. By tracking the fitness decline of ligase ribozyme populations with bottleneck sizes between 100 and 3000 molecules, we detected the appearance and subsequent fixation of both slightly deleterious mutations and advantageous mutations. Smaller populations went extinct in significantly fewer generations than did larger ones, supporting the notion of a mutational meltdown. These data suggest that mutation accumulation was an important evolutionary force in the prebiotic RNA world and that mechanisms such as recombination to ameliorate genetic loads may have been in place early in the history of life.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Clonal growth is a common feature in flowering plants. As clone size increases, the selfing rate in self-compatible species is likely to increase due to more frequent geitono-pollination events (i.e. pollination among flowers within the same genet). This study investigated the breeding system of the marsh cinquefoil (Comarum palustre) and assessed spatial distribution of clones, clone size and architecture, and their effects on realized outcrossing rates. In addition, pollen dispersal was investigated in two patchy populations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The species' breeding system was investigated under controlled conditions through hand pollinations (self- vs. cross-pollination). Using microsatellite markers, an assessment was made of the realized outcrossing rates and the genetic diversity in four natural populations, the clonal structure in two populations within five 15 × 15 m sampling plots following 0.5 × 0.5 m grids, and the pollen dispersal through paternity assignment tests in those two populations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS: Comarum palustre is a self-compatible species but only presents a low rate of spontaneous self-pollination. The occurrence of inbreeding depression was not detected at the seed set stage ($\delta$(SS) = 0.04). Clones were spatially clumped (A(C) = 0.60-0.80), with intermediate to no intermingling of the ramets (D(C) = 0.40-1.00). Genet size ranged from one to 171 ramets. Patchy populations had low outcrossing rates (t(m) = 0.33-0.46). Large clones showed lower outcrossing rates than small clones. Pollen dispersal mainly occurred within patches as only 1-7 {\%} of the pollination events occurred between patches of {\textgreater}25 m separation. Seedling recruitment events were detected.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Genet size together with distances between patches, through increasing geitono-pollination events, appeared to be important factors influencing realized outcrossing rates. The study also revealed seed flow allowing seedling recruitment, which may contribute to increasing the number of new patches, and potentially further enhance gene flow within populations.},

@article{Sommer2005,
	abstract = {Genetic studies have typically inferred the effects of human impact by documenting patterns of genetic differentiation and levels of genetic diversity among potentially isolated populations using selective neutral markers such as mitochondrial control region sequences, microsatellites or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). However, evolutionary relevant and adaptive processes within and between populations can only be reflected by coding genes. In vertebrates, growing evidence suggests that genetic diversity is particularly important at the level of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). MHC variants influence many important biological traits, including immune recognition, susceptibility to infectious and autoimmune diseases, individual odours, mating preferences, kin recognition, cooperation and pregnancy outcome. These diverse functions and characteristics place genes of the MHC among the best candidates for studies of mechanisms and significance of molecular adaptation in vertebrates. MHC variability is believed to be maintained by pathogen-driven selection, mediated either through heterozygote advantage or frequency-dependent selection. Up to now, most of our knowledge has derived from studies in humans or from model organisms under experimental, laboratory conditions. Empirical support for selective mechanisms in free-ranging animal populations in their natural environment is rare. In this review, I first introduce general information about the structure and function of MHC genes, as well as current hypotheses and concepts concerning the role of selection in the maintenance of MHC polymorphism. The evolutionary forces acting on the genetic diversity in coding and non-coding markers are compared. Then, I summarise empirical support for the functional importance of MHC variability in parasite resistance with emphasis on the evidence derived from free-ranging animal populations investigated in their natural habitat. Finally, I discuss the importance of adaptive genetic variability with respect to human impact and conservation, and implications for future studies.},

	abstract = {By viewing the ancestral recombination graph as defining a sequence of trees, we show how possible evolutionary histories consistent with given data can be constructed using the minimum number of recombination events. In contrast to previously known methods, which yield only estimated lower bounds, our method of detecting recombination always gives the minimum number of recombination events if the right kind of rooted trees are used in our algorithm. A new lower bound can be defined if rooted trees with fewer constraints are used. As well as studying how often it actually is equal to the minimum, we test how this new lower bound performs in comparison to some other lower bounds. Our study indicates that the new lower bound is an improvement on earlier bounds. Also, using simulated data, we investigate how well our method can recover the actual site-specific evolutionary relationships. In the presence of recombination, using a single tree to describe the evolution of the entire locus clearly leads to lower average recovery percentages than does our method. Our study shows that recovering the actual local tree topologies can be done more accurately than estimating the actual number of recombination events.},

Yet, host-parasite coevolution requires host susceptibility and parasite virulence to be genetically variable. In spite of evolutionary and epidemiological implications of genetic heterogeneities in host-parasite systems, evidence concerning natural populations is still scarce.

	abstract = {We demonstrate experimentally that differences in genital characters impose a direct cost of interspecific copulation on two closely related carabid species, Carabus (Ohomopterus) maiyasanus and C. (O.) iwawakianus, that share a narrow hybrid zone. Males of both species attempted copulation indiscriminately between conspecific and heterospecific females. Females experiencing heterospecific mating often suffered mortality due to rupture of their vaginal membranes. Those without fatal injury laid eggs which developed into F1 adults, but the fertilization rate was much lower than for intraspecific pairs. Males of C. maiyasanus, but not C. iwawakianus, often had broken genital parts (copulatory pieces) following interspecific copulations, which may prevent normal copulation in subsequent matings. Because of female mortality and low fertilization rate, the estimated fitness cost of interspecific mating was very large in terms of the reduction in the number of offspring (hatching larvae) for both sexes and both species. Thus, genital lock and key appears to exert significant selection against hybridization in the hybrid zone of these carabid beetles.},

We tested for the genetic signature of population decline using heterozygosity excess, shifts in allele frequencies, and low ratios of allelic number to allelic size range (M-ratios). We found different results among the three tests. All 10 populations had low M-ratios, five had shifts in allele frequencies and only two had significant heterozygosity excesses.

	abstract = {Dispersal influences the evolution and adaptation of organisms, but it can be difficult to detect. Host-specific parasites provide information about the dispersal of their hosts and may be valuable for examining host dispersal that does not result in gene flow or that has low signals of gene flow. We examined the population connectivity of the buffy flower bat, Erophylla sezekorni (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae), and its associated obligate ectoparasite, Trichobius frequens (Diptera: Streblidae), across a narrow oceanic channel in The Bahamas that has previously been implicated as a barrier to dispersal in bats. Due to the horizontal transmission of T. frequens, we were able to test the hypothesis that bats are dispersing across this channel, but this dispersal does not result in gene flow, occurs rarely, or started occurring recently. We developed novel microsatellite markers for the family Streblidae in combination with previously developed markers for bats to genotype individuals from 4 islands in The Bahamas. We provide evidence for a single population of the host, E. sezekorni, but 2 populations of its bat flies, potentially indicating a recent reduction of gene flow in E. sezekorni, rare dispersal, or infrequent transportation of bat flies with their hosts. Despite high population differentiation in bat flies indicated by microsatellites, mitochondrial DNA shows no polymorphism, suggesting that bacterial reproductive parasites may be contributing to mitochondrial DNA sweeps. Parasites, including bat flies, provide independent information about their hosts and can be used to test hypotheses of host dispersal that may be difficult to assess using host genetics alone. },

	abstract = {Knowledge of kin relationships between members of wild animal populations has broad application in ecology and evolution research by allowing the investi- gation of dispersal dynamics, mating systems, inbreeding avoidance, kin recog- nition, and kin selection as well as aiding the management of endangered populations. However, the assessment of kinship among members of wild ani- mal populations is difficult in the absence of detailed multigenerational pedi- grees. Here, we first review the distinction between genetic relatedness and kinship derived from pedigrees and how this makes the identification of kin using genetic data inherently challenging. We then describe useful approaches to kinship classification, such as parentage analysis and sibship reconstruction, and explain how the combined use of marker systems with biparental and uni- parental inheritance, demographic information, likelihood analyses, relatedness coefficients, and estimation of misclassification rates can yield reliable classifica- tions of kinship in groups with complex kin structures. We outline alternative approaches for cases in which explicit knowledge of dyadic kinship is not neces- sary, but indirect inferences about kinship on a group- or population-wide scale suffice, such as whether more highly related dyads are in closer spatial proxim- ity. Although analysis of highly variable microsatellite loci is still the dominant approach for studies on wild populations, we describe how the long-awaited use of large-scale single-nucleotide polymorphism and sequencing data derived from noninvasive low-quality samples may eventually lead to highly accurate assessments of varying degrees of kinship in wild populations.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Phylogenies are increasingly used in all fields of medical and biological research. Moreover, because of the next-generation sequencing revolution, datasets used for conducting phylogenetic analyses grow at an unprecedented pace. RAxML (Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood) is a popular program for phylogenetic analyses of large datasets under maximum likelihood. Since the last RAxML paper in 2006, it has been continuously maintained and extended to accommodate the increasingly growing input datasets and to serve the needs of the user community. Results: I present some of the most notable new features and extensions of RAxML, such as a substantial extension of substitution models and supported data types, the introduction of SSE3, AVX and AVX2 vector intrinsics, techniques for reducing the memory requirements of the code and a plethora of operations for conducting postanalyses on sets of trees.

Our study aimed to find out whether this tick can also transmit also rickettsiae of the spotted fever group (SFG). DNA extracts from 560 ticks (28 females, 34 males, and 488 nymphs) collected in different wooded areas in northern Poland were examined by PCR for the detection of Rickettsia sp., using a primer set RpCS.877p and RpCS.1258n designated to amplify a 381-bp fragment of gltA gene. A total of 2.9{\%} ticks was found to be positive. The percentage of infected females and males was comparable (10.5{\%} and 11.8{\%}, respectively) and 6.6-7.6 times higher than in nymphs (1.6{\%}). Sequences of four PCR-derived DNA fragments (acc. no. DQ672603) demonstrated 99{\%} similarity with the sequence of Rickettsia helvetica deposited in GenBank. The results obtained suggest the possible role of I. ricinus as a source of a microorganism, which recently has been identified as an agent of human rickettsioses in Europe.},

@article{Stefka2011,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parasites are evolutionary hitchhikers whose phylogenies often track the evolutionary history of their hosts. Incongruence in the evolutionary history of closely associated lineages can be explained through a variety of possible events including host switching and host independent speciation. However, in recently diverged lineages stochastic population processes, such as retention of ancestral polymorphism or secondary contact, can also explain discordant genealogies, even in fully co-speciating taxa. The relatively simple biogeographic arrangement of the Gal{\'{a}}pagos archipelago, compared with mainland biomes, provides a framework to identify stochastic and evolutionary informative components of genealogic data in these recently diverged organisms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Mitochondrial DNA sequences were obtained for four species of Gal{\'{a}}pagos mockingbirds and three sympatric species of ectoparasites--two louse and one mite species. These data were complemented with nuclear EF1$\alpha$ sequences in selected samples of parasites and with information from microsatellite loci in the mockingbirds. Mitochondrial sequence data revealed differences in population genetic diversity between all taxa and varying degrees of topological congruence between host and parasite lineages. A very low level of genetic variability and lack of congruence was found in one of the louse parasites, which was excluded from subsequent joint analysis of mitochondrial data. The reconciled multi-species tree obtained from the analysis is congruent with both the nuclear data and the geological history of the islands.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The gene genealogies of Gal{\'{a}}pagos mockingbirds and two of their ectoparasites show strong phylogeographic correlations, with instances of incongruence mostly explained by ancestral genetic polymorphism. A third parasite genealogy shows low levels of genetic diversity and little evidence of co-phylogeny with their hosts. These differences can mostly be explained by variation in life-history characteristics, primarily host specificity and dispersal capabilities. We show that pooling genetic data from organisms living in close ecological association reveals a more accurate phylogeographic history for these taxa. Our results have implications for the conservation and taxonomy of Gal{\'{a}}pagos mockingbirds and their parasites.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) inhabit the coastlines of large and small islands throughout the Gal{\'{a}}pagos archipelago, providing a rich system to study the spatial and temporal factors influencing the phylogeographic distribution and population structure of a species. Here, we analyze the microevolution of marine iguanas using the complete mitochondrial control region (CR) as well as 13 microsatellite loci representing more than 1200 individuals from 13 islands. RESULTS: CR data show that marine iguanas occupy three general clades: one that is widely distributed across the northern archipelago, and likely spread from east to west by way of the South Equatorial current, a second that is found mostly on the older eastern and central islands, and a third that is limited to the younger northern and western islands. Generally, the CR haplotype distribution pattern supports the colonization of the archipelago from the older, eastern islands to the younger, western islands. However, there are also signatures of recurrent, historical gene flow between islands after population establishment. Bayesian cluster analysis of microsatellite genotypes indicates the existence of twenty distinct genetic clusters generally following a one-cluster-per-island pattern. However, two well-differentiated clusters were found on the easternmost island of San Crist{\'{o}}bal, while nine distinct and highly intermixed clusters were found on youngest, westernmost islands of Isabela and Fernandina. High mtDNA and microsatellite genetic diversity were observed for populations on Isabela and Fernandina that may be the result of a recent population expansion and founder events from multiple sources. CONCLUSIONS: While a past genetic study based on pure FST analysis suggested that marine iguana populations display high levels of nuclear (but not mitochondrial) gene flow due to male-biased dispersal, the results of our sex-biased dispersal tests and the finding of strong genetic differentiation between islands do not support this view. Therefore, our study is a nice example of how recently developed analytical tools such as Bayesian clustering analysis and DNA sequence-based demographic analyses can overcome potential biases introduced by simply relying on FST estimates from markers with different inheritance patterns.},

	abstract = {Aim Our aim was to investigate genetic structure in Neotropical populations of common green iguanas (Iguana iguana) and to compare that structure with past geological events and present barriers. Additionally, we compared levels of divergence between lineages within Iguana with those within closely related genera in the subfamily Iguaninae. Location Neotropics. Methods DNA sequence data were collected at four loci for up to 81 individ- uals from 35 localities in 21 countries. The four loci, one mitochondrial (ND4) and three nuclear (PAC, NT3, c-mos), were chosen for their differences in coa- lescent and mutation rates. Each locus was analysed separately to generate gene trees, and in combination in a species-level analysis. Results The pairwise divergence between Iguana delicatissima and I. iguana was much greater than that between sister species of Conolophus and Cyclura and non-sister species of Sauromalus, at both mitochondrial (mean 10.5{\%} vs. 1.5--4{\%}, respectively) and nuclear loci (mean 1{\%} vs. 0--0.18{\%}, respectively). Furthermore, divergences within I. iguana were equal to or greater than those for interspecific comparisons within the outgroup genera. Phylogenetic analyses yielded four strongly supported, geographically defined mitochondrial clades (3.8--5{\%} divergence) within I. iguana. Three of the four clades were found using PAC (0.18--1.65{\%} divergence) and two using NT3 (0.6{\%} divergence) alone. The primary divergence, recovered in three polymorphic loci, was between individuals north and south of the Isthmus of Panama. The southern group was differentiated into clades comprising individuals on either side of the northern Andes, using both PAC and ND4. Main conclusions Deep genetic divergences were found within I. iguana that are congruent with past and current geological barriers. These divisions are greater than sister species comparisons in other Iguaninae genera, indicating the possible presence of cryptic species. Geological changes from the mid- Miocene through the Plio-Pleistocene have shaped the pattern of divergence in I. iguana. The uplift of the northern Andes presented a barrier between South American I. iguana populations by 4 Ma. Populations north of the Isthmus of Panama form a clade that is distinct from those to the south, and may have expanded northwards following the closing of the Isthmus of Pan- ama 2.5 Ma.},

Haplotypes can be obtained, at considerable cost, experimentally or (partially) through genotyping of additional family members. Alternatively, a statistical method can be used to infer phase and to reconstruct haplotypes. We present a new statistical method, applicable to genotype data at linked loci from a population sample, that improves substantially on current algorithms; often, error rates are reduced by {\textgreater} 50{\%}, relative to its nearest competitor. Furthermore, our algorithm performs well in absolute terms, suggesting that reconstructing haplotypes experimentally or by genotyping additional family members may be an inefficient use of resources.},

	abstract = {White Sands pupfish (Cyprinodon tularosa) are endemic to southern New Mexico and occur in only four localities: Malpais Spring, Salt Creek, Mound Spring and Lost River. Recently reported historical accounts indicate that the latter two populations were derived from translocations. Their limited distribution and complicated history suggest that knowledge of population genetic structure would be useful for the development of a sound conservation strategy. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences for a segment of the control region showed little variation. Variation was observed for microsatellite and allozyme loci with 37{\%} attributable to divergence among populations. The mean genetic distance between Malpais Spring and the other three populations was high (allozymes: Darc = 0.541; microsatellites: Rst = 0.684) compared with the mean distance among the other three populations (Darc= 0.161, Rst = [minus sign]0.016). There were fixed or nearly fixed differences in allele frequency between the Malpais Spring population and the other three populations at one allozyme locus (hexokinase) and two microsatellite loci (WSP-02 and WSP-11). We suggest the recognition of two evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) for the White Sands pupfish: Malpais Spring and Salt Creek. Our data indicate that the Lost River and Mound Spring populations descended from translocations from the Salt Creek population. Therefore, conservation efforts should focus on the Malpais Spring population.},

The characteristics of the statistic, in particular its relationship with population genotypic diversity, are formalised and a method of predicting the genotypic diversity of a sample drawn from a panmictic population using allelic frequencies and sample size is developed. The sensitivity of some possible tests of significance of the deviation from panmictic expectations is examined using computer simulations. Goodness-of-fit tests are robust but produce an unacceptably high level of type I1 error. With means and variances calculated either from Monte Carlo simulations or from distributional and series approximations, t-tests perform better than goodness-of-fit tests. Under simulation, both forms of t-test exhibit acceptable rates of type I error. Rates of type I1 are usually large when allele frequencies are severely skewed although the latter test performs the better in those conditions.},

@article{Stothard1994,
	abstract = {The eubacterial genus Rickettsia belongs to the alpha subgroup of the phylum Proteobacteria. This genus is usually divided into three biotypes on the basis of vector host and antigenic cross-reactivity characteristics. However, the species Rickettsia bellii does not fit into this classification scheme; this organism has characteristics common to both the spotted fever group and the typhus group biotypes and also exhibits some unique features. Sequences of the 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA genes from Rickettsia rickettsii (spotted fever group), Rickettsia prowazekii (typhus group), and R. bellii were studied to determine the position of R. bellii in the rickettsial classification scheme. The 23S rRNA gene sequences described in this paper are the first 23S rRNA sequences reported for any member of the Rickettsiaceae. The 23S rRNA gene contains substantially more phylogenetic information than is contained in the 16S rRNA sequences, and the 23S rRNA gene sequence has diverged about 1.9 times faster in the three Rickettsia species which we studied. Taken together, the molecular data obtained from the two genes indicate that R. bellii is not a member of either the spotted fever group or the typhus group; rather, this organism appears to be the product of a divergence which predates the separation of the genus into the spotted fever group and the typhus group. Consequently, different combinations of the ancestral characteristics retained by R. bellii have been retained in the more derived lineages of the genus.},

	abstract = {Many animal species display striking color differences with respect to geographic location, sex, and body region. Traditional adaptive explanations for such complex patterns invoke an interaction between selection for conspicuous signals and natural selection for crypsis. Although there is now a substantial body of evidence supporting the role of sexual selection for signaling functions, quantitative studies of crypsis remain comparatively rare. Here, we combine objective measures of coloration with information on predator visual sensitivities to study the role of crypsis in the evolution of color variation in an Australian lizard species complex (Ctenophorus decresii). We apply a model that allows us to quantify crypsis in terms of the visual contrast of the lizards against their natural backgrounds, as perceived by potential avian predators. We then use these quantitative estimates of crypsis to answer the following questions. Are there significant differences in crypsis/conspicuousness among populations? Are there significant differences in crypsis conspicuousness between the sexes? Are body regions "exposed" to visual predators more cryptic than "hidden" body regions? Is there evidence for local adaptation with respect to crypsis against different substrates? In general, our results confirmed that there are real differences in crypsis/conspicuousness both between populations and between sexes; that exposed body regions were significantly more cryptic than hidden ones, particularly in females; and that females, but not males, are more cryptic against their own local background than against the background of other populations [corrected]. Body regions that varied most in contrast between the sexes and between populations were also most conspicuous and are emphasized by males during social and sexual signaling. However, results varied with respect to the aspect of coloration studied. Results based on chromatic contrast ("hue" of color) provided better support for the crypsis hypothesis than did results based on achromatic contrast ("brightness" of color). Taken together, these results support the view that crypsis plays a substantial role in the evolution of color variation and that color patterns represent a balance between the need for conspicuousness for signaling and the need for crypsis to avoid predation.},

We report the largest study of new mutations to date, comprising 2,058 germline changes discovered by analyzing 85,289 Icelanders at 2,477 microsatellites. The paternal-to-maternal mutation rate ratio is 3.3, and the rate in fathers doubles from age 20 to 58, whereas there is no association with age in mothers. Longer microsatellite alleles are more mutagenic and tend to decrease in length, whereas the opposite is seen for shorter alleles. We use these empirical observations to build a model that we apply to individuals for whom we have both genome sequence and microsatellite data, allowing us to estimate key parameters of evolution without calibration to the fossil record. We infer that the sequence mutation rate is 1.4-2.3×10(-8) mutations per base pair per generation (90{\%} credible interval) and that human-chimpanzee speciation occurred 3.7-6.6 million years ago.},

	abstract = {There is a substantial literature on the use of linkage disequilibrium (LD) to estimate effective population size using unlinked loci. The Ne estimates are extremely sensitive to the sampling process, and there is currently no theory to cope with the possible biases. We derive formulae for the analysis of idealised populations mating at random with multi-allelic (microsatellite) loci. The 'Burrows composite index' is introduced in a novel way with a 'composite haplotype table'. We show that in a sample of diploid size S, the mean value of x2 or r2 from the composite haplotype table is biased by a factor of 1-1/(2S-1)2, rather than the usual factor 1+1/(2S-1) for a conventional haplotype table. But analysis of population data using these formulae leads to Ne estimates that are unrealistically low. We provide theory and simulation to show that this bias towards low Ne estimates is due to null alleles, and introduce a randomised permutation correction to compensate for the bias. We also consider the effect of introducing a within-locus disequilibrium factor to r2, and find that this factor leads to a bias in the Ne estimate. However this bias can be overcome using the same randomised permutation correction, to yield an altered r2 with lower variance than the original r2, and one that is also insensitive to null alleles. The resulting formulae are used to provide Ne estimates on 40 samples of the Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni, from populations with widely divergent Ne expectations. Linkage relationships are known for most of the microsatellite loci in this species. We find that there is little difference in the estimated Ne values from using known unlinked loci as compared to using all loci, which is important for conservation studies where linkage relationships are unknown.},

	abstract = {The distribution of vector meals in the host community is an important element of understanding and predicting vector-borne disease risk. Lizards (such as the western fence lizard; Sceloporus occidentalis) play a unique role in Lyme disease ecology in the far-western United States. Lizards rather than mammals serve as the blood meal hosts for a large fraction of larval and nymphal western black-legged ticks (Ixodes pacificus-the vector for Lyme disease in that region) but are not competent reservoirs for the pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi. Prior studies have suggested that the net effect of lizards is to reduce risk of human exposure to Lyme disease, a hypothesis that we tested experimentally. Following experimental removal of lizards, we documented incomplete host switching by larval ticks (5.19{\%}) from lizards to other hosts. Larval tick burdens increased on woodrats, a competent reservoir, but not on deer mice, a less competent pathogen reservoir. However, most larvae failed to find an alternate host. This resulted in significantly lower densities of nymphal ticks the following year. Unexpectedly, the removal of reservoir-incompetent lizards did not cause an increase in nymphal tick infection prevalence. The net result of lizard removal was a decrease in the density of infected nymphal ticks, and therefore a decreased risk to humans of Lyme disease.

	abstract = {An important issue in conservation biology and the study of evolution is the extent to which inbreeding depression can be reduced or reversed by natural selection. If the deleterious recessive alleles causing inbreeding depression can be 'purged' by natural selection, outbred populations that have a history of inbreeding are expected to be less susceptible to inbreeding depression. This expectation, however, has not been realized in previous laboratory experiments. In the present study, we used Drosophila melanogaster as a model system to test for an association between inbreeding history and inbreeding depression. We created six 'purged' populations from experimental lineages that had been maintained at a population size of 10 male-female pairs for 19 generations. We then measured the inbreeding depression that resulted from one generation of full-sib mating in the purged populations and in the original base population. The magnitude of inbreeding depression in the purged populations was approximately one-third of that observed in the original base population. In contrast to previous laboratory experiments, therefore, we found that inbreeding depression was reduced in populations that have a history of inbreeding. The large purging effects observed in this study may be attributable to the rate of historical inbreeding examined, which was slower than that considered in previous experiments.},

	abstract = {The genetic variability underlying many morphological and stress resistance traits may largely depend on the effects of genetic drift balanced by polygenic mutation. This model of adaptive potential has played a central role in the minimum viable population size concept and has been used to predict the effective population size necessary to prevent extinction within changing environments. However, there have been few long-term experimental studies of adaptive potential within isolated populations, and no study has thus far provided an experimental test of the drift-mutation model of quantitative genetic variation. Using the sternopleural bristle number of Drosophila melanogaster as a model quantitative trait, we performed repeated measurements of adaptive potential on 15 replicate populations of two and 10 male-female pairs over 30 and 77 generations, respectively. Declines in adaptive potential were analyzed by comparing observed and expected changes in realized heritability over time. The only significant model deviation occurred immediately after bottlenecks of two pairs, in which greater than expected declines in realized heritability were observed. This result suggests that changes in allelic diversity during bottleneck events may be as important as changes in heterozygosity in determining adaptive potential. Drift-mutation model expectations were otherwise realized over all generations. Our results validate the use of the drift-mutation model as a tool for understanding the dynamics of adaptive potential for peripheral fitness characters, but suggest caution in applying this model to recently bottlenecked populations.},

If this idea is correct, the uniformity of the genetic code would allow organisms to decipher and use genes transposed from chromosomes of foreign species, and the shared sequence of embryological development within each phylum would allow the organism to integrate these genes, particularly when the genes affect complex morphological traits.

	abstract = {Owing to the remarkable progress of molecular techniques, heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFCs) have become a popular tool to study the impact of inbreeding in natural populations. However, their underlying mechanisms are often hotly debated. Here we argue that these "debates" rely on verbal arguments with no basis in existing theory and inappropriate statistical testing, and that it is time to reconcile HFC with its historical and theoretical fundaments. We show that available data are quantitatively and qualitatively consistent with inbreeding-based theory. HFC can be used to estimate the impact of inbreeding in populations, although such estimates are bound to be imprecise, especially when inbreeding is weak. Contrary to common belief, linkage disequilibrium is not an alternative to inbreeding, but rather comes with some forms of inbreeding, and is not restricted to closely linked loci. Finally, the contribution of local chromosomal effects to HFC, while predicted by inbreeding theory, is expected to be small, and has rarely if ever proven statistically significant using adequate tests. We provide guidelines to safely interpret and quantify HFCs, and present how HFCs can be used to quantify inbreeding load and unravel the structure of natural populations.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide heterozygosity inferred from neutral markers such as microsatellites is often expected to (i) reflect individual inbreeding and (ii) covary positively with fitness, generating positive heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFCs). The often forgotten other end of the inbreeding-outbreeding continuum is outbreeding depression: past a certain degree of heterozygosity, heterozygotes tend to have lower fitness than homozygotes. Outbreeding depression arises from the breakup of co-adapted gene complexes and/or the introgression of nonlocally adapted genes. Provided that a correlation in heterozygosity exists across loci, outbreeding depression will be reflected in negative HFCs. In this issue, Olano-Marin et al. (2011a) describe negative heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFCs) in blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus (Fig. 1), whereby heterozygosity has a significant, negative effect on female hatching success and recruitment. This study, together with a similar study by the same authors published in Evolution (Olano-Marin et al. 2011b), forms an original contribution in two respects. First, in the same population, positive and negative HFCs were recorded, revealing both inbreeding and outbreeding depression depending on the trait studied (whereby both processes were reliant on unknown, and possibly different, sets of coding loci). Second, a large number of microsatellite markers were split into two functional groups: microsatellite markers were either designed using zebra finch expressed sequence tags (ESTs) or derived using traditional cloning methods and presumed to be neutral. Contrasting large classes of loci and their varying levels of polymorphism, rather than looking for one locus that would stand out among tens of randomly selected markers, pave the way for a more elegant and powerful approach to explore how HFCs vary across traits and among regions of the genome.

@article{Szulkin2007,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inbreeding depression occurs when the offspring produced as a result of matings between relatives show reduced fitness, and is generally understood as a consequence of the elevated expression of deleterious recessive alleles. How inbreeding depression varies across environments is of importance for the evolution of inbreeding avoidance behaviour, and for understanding extinction risks in small populations. However, inbreeding-by-environment (IxE) interactions have rarely been investigated in wild populations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analysed 41 years of breeding events from a wild great tit (Parus major) population and used 11 measures of the environment to categorise environments as relatively good or poor, testing whether these measures influenced inbreeding depression. Although inbreeding always, and environmental quality often, significantly affected reproductive success, there was little evidence for statistically significant I x E interactions at the level of individual analyses. However, point estimates of the effect of the environment on inbreeding depression were sometimes considerable, and we show that variation in the magnitude of the I x E interaction across environments is consistent with the expectation that this interaction is more marked across environmental axes with a closer link to overall fitness, with the environmental dependence of inbreeding depression being elevated under such conditions. Hence, our analyses provide evidence for an environmental dependence of the inbreeding x environment interaction: effectively an I x E x E. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, our analyses suggest that I x E interactions may be substantial in wild populations, when measured across relevant environmental contrasts, although their detection for single traits may require very large samples, or high rates of inbreeding.},

Although early empirical studies often reported inbreeding avoidance, recent studies suggest that animals sometimes show no avoidance or even prefer to mate with relatives. However, current theory is insufficient to predict whether animals should avoid, tolerate, or prefer inbreeding and hence to understand overall inbreeding strategy. Furthermore, quantifying inbreeding strategy is challenging, requiring relatedness among unbiased sets of actual and potential mates to be accurately estimated. Here, we highlight key limitations of current theory and empirical tests, and summarise the advances required to predict, quantify, and understand animal inbreeding strategies. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, this research field is fast-moving, involves different areas of expertise and currently lacks standard approaches, which calls for an up-to-date and comprehensive synthesis. Environmental DNA for biodiversity research and monitoring covers current methods based on eDNA, with a particular focus on ``eDNA metabarcoding''. Intended for scientists and managers, it provides the background information to allow the design of sound experiments. It revisits all steps necessary to produce high-quality metabarcoding data such as sampling, metabarcode design, optimization of PCR and sequencing protocols, as well as analysis of large sequencing datasets. All these different steps are presented by discussing the potential and current challenges of eDNA-based approaches to infer parameters on biodiversity or ecological processes. The last chapters of this book review how DNA metabarcoding has been used so far to unravel novel patterns of diversity in space and time, to detect particular species, and to answer new ecological questions in various ecosystems and for various organisms. Environmental DNA for biodiversity research and monitoring constitutes an essential reading for all graduate students, researchers and practitioners who do not have a strong background in molecular genetics and who are willing to use eDNA approaches in ecology and biomonitoring.},

It is found that the correlation between these two estimates is large when the sample size is small, and decreases slowly as the sample size increases. Using the relationship obtained, a statistical method for testing the neutral mutation hypothesis is developed. This method needs only the data of DNA polymorphism, namely the genetic variation within population at the DNA level. A simple method of computer simulation, that was used in order to obtain the distribution of a new statistic developed, is also presented. Applying this statistical method to the five regions of DNA sequences in Drosophila melanogaster, it is found that large insertion/deletion (greater than 100 bp) is deleterious. It is suggested that the natural selection against large insertion/deletion is so weak that a large amount of variation is maintained in a population.},

	abstract = {The recent expansion of a variety of morphometric tools has brought about a revolution in the comparison of morphology in the context of the size and shape in various fields including entomology. First, an overview of the theoretical issues of geometric morphometrics is presented with a caution about the usage of traditional morphometric measurements. Second, focus is then placed on two broad approaches as tools for geometric morphometrics; that is, the landmark‐based and the outline‐based approaches. A brief outline of the two methodologies is provided with some important cautions. The increasing trend of entomological studies in using the procedures of geometric morphometrics is then summarized. Finally, information is provided on useful toolkits such as computer software as well as codes and packages of the R statistical software that could be used in geometric morphometrics.},

@article{Taylor1999,
	abstract = {In contrast to the goals of the symposium from which this series of papers originated, we argue that attempts to apply unambiguously defined and general management unit criteria based solely on genetic parameters can easily lead to incorrect management decisions. We maintain that conservation genetics is best served by altering the perspective of data analysis so that decision making is optimally facilitated. To do so requires accounting for policy objectives early in the design and execution of the science. This contrasts with typical hypothesis testing approaches to analysing genetic data for determining population structure, which often aspire to objectivity by considering management objectives only after the analysis is complete. The null hypothesis is generally taken as panmixia with a strong predilection towards avoiding false acceptance of the alternative hypothesis (the existence of population structure). We show by example how defining management units using genetic data and standard scientific analyses that do not consider either the specific management objectives or the anthropogenic risks facing the populations being studied can easily result in a management failure by losing local populations. We then use the same example to show how an 'applied' approach driven by specific objectives and knowledge of abundance and mortality results in appropriate analyses and better decisions. Because management objectives stem from public policy, which differs among countries and among species groups, criteria for defining management units must be specific, not general. Therefore, we conclude that the most productive way to define management units is on a case-by-case basis. We also suggest that creating analytical tools designed specifically to address decision making in a management context, rather than re-tooling academic tools designed for other purposes, will increase and improve the use of genetics in conservation.},

	abstract = {Genetic marker-based estimators remain a popular tool for measuring related- ness (rxy) and inbreeding (F) coefficients at both the population and individual level. The performance of these estimators fluctuates with the number and vari- ability of markers available, and the relatedness composition and demographic history of a population. Several methods are available to evaluate the reliability of the estimates of rxy and F, some of which are implemented in the program COANCESTRY. I used the simulation module in COANCESTRY since assess the performance of marker-based estimators of rxy and F in a species with very low genetic diversity, New Zealand's little spotted kiwi (Apteryx owenii). I also conducted a review of published papers that have used COANCESTRY as its release to assess whether and how the reliability of the estimates of rxy and F produced by genetic markers are being measured and reported in published studies. My simulation results show that even when the correlation between true (simulated) and estimated rxy or F is relatively high (Pearson's r = 0.66-- 0.72 and 0.81--0.85, respectively) the imprecision of the estimates renders them highly unreliable on an individual basis. The literature review demonstrates that the majority of studies do not report the reliability of marker-based estimates of rxy and F. There is currently no standard practice for selecting the best esti- mator for a given data set or reporting an estimator's performance. This could lead to experimental results being interpreted out of context and render the robustness of conclusions based on measures of rxy and F debatable.},

However, the continued reproductive success of a few individuals may mask issues such as inbreeding depres- sion, especially in long-lived species. Here, we test for inbreeding depression in little spotted kiwi (Apteryx owenii) by comparing a population founded with two birds to one founded with 40 birds, both from the same source population and both showing positive population growth. We used a combination of microsatellite genotypes, nest observations and modelling to examine the consequences of assessing population via- bility exclusively via population growth. We demonstrate (i) significantly lower hatch- ing success despite significantly higher reproductive effort in the population with two founders; (ii) positive growth in the population with two founders is mainly driven by ongoing chick production of the founding pair; and (iii) a substantial genetic load in the population founded with two birds (10--15 diploid lethal equivalents). Our results illustrate that substantial, cryptic inbreeding depression may still be present when a population is growing, especially in long-lived species with overlapping generations.},

	abstract = {The Great Lakes impose high levels of natural fragmentation on local populations of terrestrial animals in a way rarely found within continental ecosystems. Although separated by major water barriers, woodland deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus gracilis) populations on the islands and on the Upper Peninsula (UP) and Lower Peninsula (LP) of Michigan have previously been shown to have a mitochondrial DNA contact zone that is incongruent with the regional landscape. We analyzed 11 microsatellite loci for 16 populations of P. m. gracilis distributed across 2 peninsulas and 6 islands in northern Michigan to address the relative importance of geographical structure and inferred postglacial colonization patterns in determining the nuclear genetic structure of this species. Results showed relatively high levels of genetic structure for this species and a significant correlation between interpopulation differentiation and separation by water but little genetic structure and no isolation-by-distance within each of the 2 peninsulas. Genetic diversity was generally high on both peninsulas but lower and correlated to island size in the Beaver Island Archipelago. These results are consistent with the genetic and demographic isolation of Lower Peninsula populations, which is a matter of concern given the dramatic decline in P. m. gracilis abundance on the Lower Peninsula in recent years. {\textcopyright} The American Genetic Association. 2011.

	abstract = {Numerous loci in host organisms are involved in parasite recognition, such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes in vertebrates or genes involved in gene-for-gene (GFG) relationships in plants. Diversity is commonly observed at such loci and at corresponding loci encoding antigenic molecules in parasites. Multilocus theoretical models of host-parasite coevolution predict that polymorphism is more likely than in single-locus interactions because recurrent coevolutionary cycles are sustained by indirect frequency-dependent selection as rare genotypes have a selective advantage. These cycles are stabilized by direct frequency-dependent selection, resulting from repeated reinfection of the same host by a parasite, a feature of most diseases. Here, it is shown that for realistically small costs of resistance and virulence, polycyclic disease and high autoinfection rates, stable polymorphism of all possible genotypes is obtained in parasite populations. Two types of epistatic interactions between loci tend to increase the parameter space in which stable polymorphism can occur with all possible host and parasite genotypes. In the parasite, the marginal cost of each additional virulence allele should increase, while in the host, the marginal cost of each additional resistance allele should decrease. It is therefore predicted that GFG polymorphism will be stable (and hence detectable) when there is partial complementation of avirulence genes in the parasite and of resistance genes in the host.},

	abstract = {We previously developed a cladistic approach to identify subsets of haplotypes defined by restriction endonuclease mapping or DNA sequencing that are associated with significant phenotypic deviations. Our approach was limited to segments of DNA in which little recombination occurs. In such cases, a cladogram can be constructed from the restriction site or sequence data that represents the evolutionary steps that interrelate the observed haplotypes. The cladogram is used to define a nested statistical design to identify mutational steps associated with significant phenotypic deviations. The central assumption behind this strategy is that any undetected mutation causing a phenotypic effect is embedded within the same evolutionary history that is represented by the cladogram. The power of this approach depends upon the confidence one has in the particular cladogram used to draw inferences. In this paper, we present a strategy for estimating the set of cladograms that are consistent with a particular sample of either restriction site or nucleotide sequence data and that includes the possibility of recombination. We first evaluate the limits of parsimony in constructing cladograms. Once these limits have been determined, we construct the set of parsimonious and nonparsimonious cladograms that is consistent with these limits. Our estimation procedure also identifies haplotypes that are candidates for being products of recombination. If recombination is extensive, our algorithm subdivides the DNA region into two or more subsections, each having little or no internal recombination. We apply this estimation procedure to three data sets to illustrate varying degrees of cladogram ambiguity and recombination.},

@article{Templeton1990,
	abstract = {The natural habitats of many species have become fragmented into small "islands," principally by human activities. In this paper we discuss the long-term genetic and evolutionary consequences of fragmentation as inferred from studies on populations that have undergone natural habitat fragmentation in the Ozark Mountains. The Ozarks are the highest land formation found in the midwestern United States. Because of the absence of major geographical barriers around the Ozarks, plants and animals from diverse parts of the continent have been able to invade the area during post-Pleistocene climatic periods. Many of these invasions were short-lived, but the geological and topographical complexity of the Ozarks provided numerous relictual habitats. As a consequence, natural habitat fragmentation occurred for many species, and the fragmentation has often persisted for thousands of years. The genetic and ecological consequences of habitat fragmentation depend critically upon whether or not habitat fragmentation results in a complete cessation of dispersal between the habitat islands. If habitat fragmentation results in the complete genetic isolation of habitat islands, then each "island" becomes demographically independent and local extinction can occur. When there is no opportunity for recolonization, an "extinction ratchet" is possible in which each local extinction brings the global population irreversibly one step closer to total extinction. It is therefore critical to know if habitat fragmentation actually prevents dispersal or not. Unfortunately, studying dispersal patterns directly is usually not feasible. We show how genetic surveys can be used to answer this question. Given demographic fragmentation, we also show how genetic surveys can pinpoint species at high risk for local extinction. These suffer the most severe genetic consequences from habitat fragmentation, such as a drastic loss of genetic variability within habitat islands and inbreeding depression. On the positive side, the genetic variation of a fragmented species is not totally lost but is often present as fixed differences between different local populations. Indeed, a fragmented population is subject to less global loss of genetic variation than an equally sized panmictic population. Consequently, as long as the rate of local extinction is relatively small or counteracted by a recolonization program, a fragmented species can preserve almost all of its genetic variation at the global level for long periods of time. We discuss the optimal design for a recolonization program to prevent global extinction and to maintain high levels of global genetic variation.},

	abstract = {This work focuses on the consequences on the genetic load and the risk of extinction when an endangered population is exposed to recurrent introductions from a captive population where selection is somewhat relaxed. Our findings suggest that, although selection pressures might be reduced in captivity, which leads to higher frequency of deleterious alleles in natural populations (Lynch and O'Hely 2001), such a population structure could have positive effects on population fitness when three conditions are met: (i) the time length of the supplementation program does not exceed a reasonable time frame, e. g., 20 generations (ii) introduction of captive individuals is kept at a low level, i.e., one or two individuals per generation (iii) the size of the captive population is reasonably large, e.g., more than 20 individuals. The positive effect is due to the fact that the supplementation program delays the increase of homozygosity of the natural population. When migration from the wild towards captivity is also allowed, the benefits with regard to genetic load increase significantly even for larger numbers of captive immigrants and a higher number of generations. We also worked out a model with explicit demographic considerations (fluctuating population sizes, captive migrants increase the size of the wild population), which shows that the probability of extinction decreases significantly with the number of introduced individuals when short-term supplementation programs are applied (up to twenty generations). Furthermore, an appropriate genetic management of the captive population, such as the equalization of family sizes, could enhance the positive effects of such supplementation programs.},

First, we show that the assumption of frequent, slightly deleterious mutations do agree with observations and experiments, on the contrary to the assumption of few, moderately deleterious mutations. For the same inbreeding coefficient, populations can greatly differ in fitness according to the following: (i) population size; larger populations show higher fitness (ii) the history of population size; in a population that recovers after a bottleneck, higher inbreeding can lead to higher fitness and (iii) population demography; population growth rate and carrying capacity determine the relationship between inbreeding and extinction. With regards to the relationship between inbreeding depression and inbreeding coefficient, the population size that minimizes inbreeding depression depends on the level of inbreeding: inbreeding depression can even decrease when population size increases. It is therefore clear that to infer the costs of inbreeding, one must know both the history of inbreeding (e.g. past bottlenecks) and population demography.},

This rule does not hold in several species of bivalves that have two mtDNA types, one that is transmitted maternally and the other paternally. This system of mitochondrial DNA transmission is known as doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI). Here we present evidence of DUI in the clam Donax trunculus making Donacidae the sixth bivalve family in which the phenomenon has been found. In addition, we present the taxonomic affiliation of all species in which DUI is currently known to occur and construct a phylogeny of the maternal and paternal genomes of these species. We use this information to address the question of a single or multiple origins of DUI and to discuss whether failed attempts to demonstrate the presence of DUI in several bivalve species might be due to problems of detection or to genuine absence of the phenomenon. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Coevolution of species is one of the major processes organizing the Earth's biodiversity. Recent coevolutionary theory has indicated that the geographic structure of species has the potential to impose powerful and continuing effects on coevolutionary dynamics, if that structure creates selection mosaics and coevolutionary hotspots across landscapes. Here we confirm that current coevolutionary selection in interspecific interactions can be highly divergent across both narrow and broad geographic scales, thereby fueling continuing coevolution of taxa. Study of a widespread plant insect interaction across a broad range of habitats for several years showed that an insect functioning both as a pollinator and a floral parasite can be strongly mutualistic in some habitats but commensal or antagonistic in neighbouring habitats. The results for one of the habitats span seven years, demonstrating that the local structure of coevolutionary selection can remain stable across multiple generations. Conservation of the evolutionary processes maintaining long-term biological diversity may require preservation of the conditions that allow a long-term shifting geographic mosaic of coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots.},

	abstract = {Recent progress in positioning technology facilitates the collection of massive amounts of sequential spatial data on animals. This has led to new opportunities and challenges when investigating animal movement behaviour and habitat selection. Tools like Step Selection Functions (SSFs) are relatively new powerful models for studying resource selection by animals moving through the landscape. SSFs compare environmental attributes of observed steps (the linear segment between two consecutive observations of position) with alternative random steps taken from the same starting point. SSFs have been used to study habitat selection, human-wildlife interactions, movement corridors, and dispersal behaviours in animals. SSFs also have the potential to depict resource selection at multiple spatial and temporal scales. There are several aspects of SSFs where consensus has not yet been reached such as how to analyse the data, when to consider habitat covariates along linear paths between observations rather than at their endpoints, how many random steps should be considered to measure availability, and how to account for individual variation. In this review we aim to address all these issues, as well as to highlight weak features of this modelling approach that should be developed by further research. Finally, we suggest that SSFs could be integrated with state-space models to classify behavioural states when estimating SSFs.},

This paper describes a combinatorial model where so-called DTL-scenarios are used to explain the differences between a gene tree and a corresponding species tree taking into account gene duplications, gene losses, and lateral gene transfers (also known as horizontal gene transfers). The reasonable biological constraint that a lateral gene transfer may only occur between contemporary species leads to the notion of acyclic DTL-scenarios. Parsimony methods are introduced by defining appropriate optimization problems. We show that finding most parsimonious acyclic DTL-scenarios is NP-hard. However, by dropping the condition of acyclicity, the problem becomes tractable, and we provide a dynamic programming algorithm as well as a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for finding most parsimonious DTL-scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

We provide the background of GPS techniques that have been used to gather data for wildlife studies. We review how GPS has been integrated into functional systems with data storage, data transfer, power supplies, packaging and sensor technologies to collect temperature, activity, proximity and mortality data from terrestrial species and birds. GPS `rapid fixing' technologies combined with sensors provide location, dive frequency and duration profiles, and underwater acoustic information for the study of marine species. We examine how these rapid fixing technologies may be applied to terrestrial and avian applications. We discuss positional data quality and the capability for high-frequency sampling associated with GPS locations. We present alternatives for storing and retrieving data by using dataloggers (biologging), radio-frequency download systems (e.g. very high frequency, spread spectrum), integration of GPS with other satellite systems (e.g. Argos, Globalstar) and potential new data recovery technologies (e.g. network nodes). GPS is one component among many rapidly evolving technologies.

	abstract = {Here, we introduce ezRAD, a novel strategy for restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) that requires little technical expertise or investment in laboratory equipment, and demonstrate its utility for ten non-model organisms across a wide taxonomic range. ezRAD differs from other RAD methods primarily through its use of standard Illumina TruSeq library preparation kits, which makes it possible for any laboratory to send out to a commercial genomic core facility for library preparation and next-generation sequencing with virtually no additional investment beyond the cost of the service itself. This simplification opens RADseq to any lab with the ability to extract DNA and perform a restriction digest. ezRAD also differs from others in its flexibility to use any restriction enzyme (or combination of enzymes) that cuts frequently enough to generate fragments of the desired size range, without requiring the purchase of separate adapters for each enzyme or a sonication step, which can further decrease the cost involved in choosing optimal enzymes for particular species and research questions. We apply this method across a wide taxonomic diversity of non-model organisms to demonstrate the utility and flexibility of our approach. The simplicity of ezRAD makes it particularly useful for the discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms and targeted amplicon sequencing in natural populations of non-model organisms that have been historically understudied because of lack of genomic information.},

The 'molecular revolution' altered traditional methods (morphological traits) of subspecies classification by applying genetic analyses resulting in alternative or contradictory classifications. We evaluated recent reptile literature for bias in the recommendations regarding subspecies status when genetic data were included. Reviewing characteristics of the study, genetic variables, genetic distance values and noting the species concepts, we found that subspecies were more likely elevated to species when using genetic analysis. However, there was no predictive relationship between variables used and taxonomic recommendation. There was a significant difference between the median genetic distance values when researchers elevated or collapsed a subspecies. Our review found nine different concepts of species used when recommending taxonomic change, and studies incorporating multiple species concepts were more likely to recommend a taxonomic change. Since using genetic techniques significantly alter reptile taxonomy there is a need to establish a standard method to determine the species-subspecies boundary in order to effectively use the subspecies classification for research and conservation purposes. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Squamate reptiles (snakes, lizards, and amphisbaenians) serve as model systems for evolutionary studies of a variety of morphological and behavioral traits, and phylogeny is crucial to many generalizations derived from such studies. Specifically, the traditional dichotomy between Iguania (anoles, iguanas, chameleons, etc.) and Scleroglossa (skinks, geckos, snakes, etc.) has been correlated with major evolutionary shifts within Squamata. We present a molecular phylogenetic study of 69 squamate species using approximately 4600 (2876 parsimony-informative) base pairs (bp) of DNA sequence data from the nuclear genes RAG-1 (∼2750 bp) and c-mos (∼360 bp) and the mitochondrial ND2 region (∼1500 bp), sampling all major clades and most major subclades. Under our hypothesis, species previously placed in Iguania, Anguimorpha, and almost all recognized squamate families form strongly supported monophyletic groups. However, species previously placed in Scleroglossa, Varanoidea, and several other higher taxa do not form monophyletic groups. Iguania, the traditional sister group of Scleroglossa, is actually highly nested within Scleroglossa. This unconventional rooting does not seem to be due to long-branch attraction, base composition biases among taxa, or convergence caused by similar selective forces acting on nonsister taxa. Studies of functional tongue morphology and feeding mode have contrasted the similar states found in Sphenodon (the nearest outgroup to squamates) and Iguania with those of Scleroglossa, but our findings suggest that similar states in Sphenodon and Iguania result from homoplasy. Snakes, amphisbaenians, and dibamid lizards, limbless forms whose phylogenetic positions historically have been impossible to place with confidence, are not grouped together and appear to have evolved this condition independently. Amphisbaenians are the sister group of lacertids, and dibamid lizards diverged early in squamate evolutionary history. Snakes are grouped with iguanians, lacertiforms, and anguimorphs, but are not nested within anguimorphs.},

	abstract = {Iguanian lizards form a diverse clade whose members have been the focus of many comparative studies of ecology, behavior, and evolution. Despite the importance of phylogeny to such studies, interrelationships among many iguanian clades remain uncertain. Within the Old World clade Acrodonta, Agamidae is sometimes found to be paraphyletic with respect to Chamaeleonidae, and recent molecular studies have produced conflicting results for many major clades. Within the largely New World clade Pleurodonta, relationships among the 12 currently recognized major subclades (mostly ranked as families) have been largely unresolved or poorly supported in previous studies. To clarify iguanian evolutionary history, we first infer phylogenies using concatenated maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian analyses of DNA sequence data from 29 nuclear protein-coding genes for 47 iguanian and 29 outgroup taxa. We then estimate a relaxed-clock Bayesian chronogram for iguanians using BEAST. All three methods produce identical topologies. Within Acrodonta, we find strong support for monophyly of Agamidae with respect to Chamaeleonidae, and for almost all relationships within agamids. Within Pleurodonta, we find strong Bayesian support for almost all relationships, and strong ML support for some interfamilial relationships and for monophyly of almost all families (excepting Polychrotidae). Our phylogenetic results suggest a non-traditional biogeographic scenario in which pleurodonts originated in the Northern Hemisphere and subsequently spread southward into South America. The pleurodont portion of the tree is characterized by several very short, deep branches, raising the possibility of deep coalescences that may confound concatenated analyses. We therefore also use 27 of these genes to implement a coalescent-based species-tree approach for pleurodonts. Although this analysis strongly supports monophyly of the pleurodont families, interfamilial relationships are generally different from those in the concatenated tree, and support is uniformly poor. However, a species-tree analysis using only the seven most variable loci yields higher support and more congruence with the concatenated tree. This suggests that low support in the 27-gene species-tree analysis may be an artifact of the many loci that are uninformative for very short branches. This may be a general problem for the application of species-tree methods to rapid radiations, even with phylogenomic data sets. Finally, we correct the non-monophyly of Polychrotidae by recognizing the pleurodont genus Anolis (sensu lato) as a separate family (Dactyloidae), and we correct the non-monophyly of the agamid genus Physignathus by resurrection of the genus Istiurus for the former Physignathus lesueurii. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Deleterious recessive alleles that are masked in outbred populations are predicted to be expressed in small, inbred populations, reducing both individual fitness and population viability. However, there are few definitive examples of phenotypic expression of lethal recessive alleles under inbreeding conditions in wild populations. Studies that demonstrate the action of such alleles, and infer their distribution and dynamics, are required to understand their potential impact on population viability and inform management responses. The Scottish population of red-billed choughs (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax), which currently totals {\textless}60 breeding pairs and is of major conservation concern, has recently been affected by lethal blindness in nestlings. We used family data to show that the pattern of occurrence of blindness within and across affected families that produced blind nestlings was exactly 0{\textperiodcentered}25, matching that expected given a single-locus autosomal lethal recessive allele. Furthermore, the observed distribution of blind nestlings within affected families did not differ from that expected given Mendelian inheritance of such an allele. Relatedness estimates showed that individuals from affected families were not more closely related to each other than they were to individuals from unaffected families that did not produce blind nestlings. Blind individuals tended to be less heterozygous than non-blind individuals, as expected if blindness was caused by the expression of a recessive allele under inbreeding. However, there was no difference in the variance in heterozygosity estimates, suggesting that some blind individuals were relatively outbred. These results suggest carriers of the blindness allele may be widely distributed across contemporary families rather than restricted to a single family lineage, implying that the allele has persisted across multiple generations. Blindness occurred at low frequency (affecting 1{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} of observed nestlings since 1981). However, affected families had larger initial brood sizes than unaffected families. Such high fecundity of carriers of a lethal recessive allele might reflect overdominance, potentially reducing purging and increasing allele persistence probability. We thereby demonstrate the phenotypic expression of a lethal recessive allele in a wild population of conservation concern, and provide a general framework for inferring allele distribution and persistence and informing management responses.},

	abstract = {The Gal{\'{a}}pagos land iguanas (genus Conolophus) have faced significant anthropogenic disturbances since the 17th century, leading to severe reduction of some populations and the extinction of others. Conservation activities, including the repatriation of captive-bred animals to depleted areas, have been ongoing since the late 1970s, but genetic information has not been extensively incorporated. Here we use nine species-specific microsatellite loci of 703 land iguanas from the six islands where the species occur today to characterize the genetic diversity within, and the levels of genetic differentiation among, current populations as well as test previous hypotheses about accidental translocations associated with early conservation efforts. Our analyses indicate that (i) five populations of iguanas represent distinct conservation units (one of them being the recently discovered rosada form) and could warrant species status, (ii) some individuals from North Seymour previously assumed to be from the natural Baltra population appear related to both Isabela and Santa Cruz populations, and (iii) the five different management units exhibit considerably different levels of intrapopulation genetic diversity, with the Plaza Sur and Santa Fe populations particularly low. Although the initial captive breeding programmes, coupled with intensive efforts to eradicate introduced species, saved several land iguana populations from extinction, our molecular results provide objective data for improving continuing in situ species survival plans and population management for this spectacular and emblematic reptile.},

While it took 80 years to reach the first 1000 species in 1838, species descriptions since then have been added roughly at the rate of 1000 new species every 20 years, with a significant acceleration only during the past two decades. The top 40 most productive herpetologists (in terms of ``species output'') have described 4780 species, amounting to over half of all species. George Albert Boulenger leads this elite list with 573 species that are still recognized today. Historically, 18 classic works of the 18th and 19th century can be singled out, describing almost 1000 species still recognized, including the Erp{\'{e}}tologie G{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}rale, published between 1834 and 1854 in nine volumes.

	abstract = {The evolution of female promiscuity poses an intriguing problem as benefits of mating with multiple males often have to arise via indirect, genetic, effects. Studies on birds have documented that multiple paternity is common in natural populations but strong evidence for selection via female benefits is lacking. In an attempt to evaluate the evidence more broadly, we review studies of multiple paternity in natural populations of all major groups of nonavian reptiles. Multiple paternity has been documented in all species investigated so far and commonly exists in over 50{\%} of clutches, with particularly high levels in snakes and lizards. Marine turtles and lizards with prolonged pair-bonding have relatively low levels of multiple paternity but levels are nevertheless higher than in many vertebrates with parental care. There is no evidence that high levels of polyandry are driven by direct benefits to females and the evidence that multiple paternity arises from indirect genetic benefits is weak. Instead, we argue that the most parsimonious explanation for patterns of multiple paternity is that it represents the combined effect of mate-encounter frequency and conflict over mating rates between males and females driven by large male benefits and relatively small female costs, with only weak selection via indirect benefits. A crucial step for researchers is to move from correlative approaches to experimental tests of assumptions and predictions of theory under natural settings, using a combination of molecular techniques and behavioural observations.},

	abstract = {Theory suggests that host-parasite interaction should lead to local adaptation of parasites to their hosts and vice versa. The degree of local adaptation depends on, for example, migration, relative generation time of host and parasite, and the number of host species. Furthermore, in any coevolutionary process, local adaptation of one species is dependent on the evolution of sympatric and allopatric populations of the other species, and the degree of gene flow. The tick Ixodes ricinus is a generalist tick feeding on hosts of a variety of taxa. We contrasted populations of common lizards (Lacerta vivipara) differing in their evolutionary history of exposure to ticks. Juvenile lizards were raised in a common garden experiment. We monitored growth rate, physiological performance, and aspects of immune function in tick-exposed and control offspring. There were no differences in response to tick infestation between host populations, with both sympatric and allopatric hosts showing impaired growth and endurance under parasite exposure. Ticks were marginally more engorged on allopatric hosts (P = 0.06); hence, our results do not support the hypothesis of local adaptation of parasites.},

The package allows to compare results obtained with these four approaches, since an analogous analysis can be performed according to each geometry, with minimal and straightforward modifications of the instructions. Beside these grounding classes, the package also includes: the most-basic features such as data transformations (e.g. logarithm, or additive logistic transform), basic statistics (both the classical ones, and those developed in the log-ratio framework of compositional analysis), high-level graphics (like ternary diagram matrix and scatter-plots) and high-level analysis (e.g. principal components or cluster analysis).

Ixodes are represented by 26 species, and in 2007 the first reported ticks vectors in Mexico for the causal agent of Lyme disease. Recent rise in tick-borne disease in many parts of the world is a phenomenon in need of an explanation. The main objective of the present work was to map at a regional scale (1:2,000,000) of the distribution of ticks of the family Ixodidae that are potentially present on the wild fauna of state of Michoacan, Mexico. We compiled all available literature on ticks at a national level together with complete cartographic and bibliographic georeferenced information of the distribution of hosts in order to build a spatial database in ArcView 3.3. The results indicated that the wild fauna in the state's territory could potentially include 31 species of ticks of Ixodidae. The map of potential species richness of ixodid ticks on the wild fauna of the state can be categorized into five classes of species richness. The highest potential concentration of ixodid species on wild fauna occurs in the volcanic area of Pico de Tanc{\'{i}}taro.},

Here, we present results from a preliminary study comparing levels of asymmetry in various characteristics between two island populations of the Italian Wall Lizard (Podarcis sicula), one of which was recently founded. We relate individual asymmetry to several measures of physiological performance. Levels of FA varied clearly among the traits studied. Repeatability of FA estimates was high for meristic traits but low for metric traits. Levels of FA were on average higher in the newly founded population. We found a significant decrease in exertion (time until exhaustion by continuously chasing) with increasing levels of fluctuating asymmetry (i.e., more symmetric individuals had a higher exertion). Speed of locomotion showed a positive trend with increasing FA. No relationship was found between individual levels of FA and bite force. These results suggest that FA estimates, based on the accurate measurement of several traits, may be useful in explaining differences in developmental stability and physiological performance at the individual and population level.},

	abstract = {Ecological interactions that involve aggressive confrontations between animals are important in shaping the evolution of morphology, behaviour and life history. However, as such confrontations are rarely witnessed, direct quantification of the intensity of these processes in natural populations is notoriously difficult. While the utilization of the frequency of non-lethal injuries is fraught with difficulties, it may provide information concerning different types of interaction, such as predation, intraspecific aggression and interspecific interference competition. In this paper, we report on an exceptionally large difference in toe loss incidence between two populations of Podarcis sicula lizards living on small, neighbouring islands in the Adriatic Sea. We caught 900 lizards and recorded the number and location of missing toes. Subsequently, we investigated five non-mutually exclusive hypotheses concerning differences in bite force capacity, bone strength, predation intensity, average age and intraspecific aggression that may provide proximate explanations for the observed differences in injury frequencies. Bite force differences differed considerably between the populations, but bone strength was found to be stronger in the populations with a higher frequency of natural scars. Predation pressure clearly differed between the populations, but we found higher injury rates under predation relaxation. Our results indicate that density and consequently an increased intraspecific competition is the most likely explanation for the observed high frequencies of injuries. We suggest that the intensity of toe amputation between lizard populations may be a useable indirect indication for the intensity of intraspecific competition. This study shows how a combination of morphological, physiological, behavioural and ecological measurements can be used to test assumptions implicit to alternative explanations of an observed phenomenon. Such tests can reveal how likely each of these explanations is, even if the processes leading to the phenomenon are difficult to observe directly},

@article{Vijay2017,
	abstract = {Abstract Genomewide screens of genetic variation within and between populations can reveal signatures of selection implicated in adaptation and speciation. Genomic regions with low genetic diversity and elevated differentiation reflective of locally reduced effective population sizes (Ne) are candidates for barrier loci contributing to population divergence. Yet, such candidate genomic regions need not arise as a result of selection promoting adaptation or advancing reproductive isolation. Linked selection unrelated to lineage-specific adaptation or population divergence can generate comparable signatures. It is challenging to distinguish between these processes, particularly when diverging populations share ancestral genetic variation. In this study, we took a comparative approach using population assemblages from distant clades assessing genomic parallelism of variation in Ne. Utilizing population-level polymorphism data from 444 resequenced genomes of three avian clades spanning 50 million years of evolution, we tested whether population genetic summary statistics reflecting genomewide variation in Ne would covary among populations within clades, and importantly, also among clades where lineage sorting has been completed. All statistics including population-scaled recombination rate (?), nucleotide diversity ($\pi$) and measures of genetic differentiation between populations (FST, PBS, dxy) were significantly correlated across all phylogenetic distances. Moreover, genomic regions with elevated levels of genetic differentiation were associated with inferred pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions. The phylogenetic stability of diversity landscapes and stable association with genomic features support a role of linked selection not necessarily associated with adaptation and speciation in shaping patterns of genomewide heterogeneity in genetic diversity.},

The iconic marsupial has dramatically declined in number since the discovery of devil facial tumor disease in 1996 and efforts are being made to uncover vital information to assist in the long-term survival of the species. Ticks are the main vectors of arthropod-borne disease in animals, raising the question of whether Tasmanian devils may be host to arthropods capable of harboring infectious agents. Partially engorged ticks were collected from 35 wild Tasmanian devils and tested for the presence of a range of tick-borne genera. A spotted fever group Rickettsia was detected in 45.5{\%} of samples of the tick Ixodes tasmani (n = 44), from all trapping locations, sharing close sequence identity to members of the Rickettsia massiliae group. A Hepatozoon species was also identified in 34.1{\%} of the same sample set, sharing sequence similarities to Hepatozoon felis, a known pathogen of felids. Dual detection was identified in 13.6{\%} of tick samples, where prevalence of the two genera overlapped. The existence of two previously undetected species of genera known for containing pathogens identifies additional potential risks to the health of the devil population. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report that females can incur high energetic costs as a result of discriminating among potential mates. We used heart rate biologging to quantify energetic expenditure in lek-mating female Gal{\'{a}}pagos marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus). Receptive females spent 78.9+/-23.2 kJ of energy on mate choice over a 30-day period, which is equivalent to approximately (3/4) of one day's energy budget. Females that spent more time on the territories of high-quality, high-activity males displayed greater energetic expenditure on mate choice, lost more mass, and showed a trend towards producing smaller follicles. Choosy females also appear to face a reduced probability of survival if El Ni{\~{n}}o conditions occur in the year following breeding. These findings indicate that female choice can carry significant costs, and suggest that the benefits that lek-mating females gain through mating with a preferred male may be higher than previously predicted.},

Despite its prevalence, the underlying physiology of island tameness is not known. Here we report that although Gal{\'{a}}pagos marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) initiated flight from an evolutionarily recent and unfamiliar potential predator (humans), they failed to show the cardiovascular stress response that facilitates successful escape, even after a prior capture experience. In contrast, when approached by a native predator (the Gal{\'{a}}pagos hawk; Buteo galapagoensis), marine iguanas show markedly increased heart rate independent of initiating escape movement. The secretion of catecholamines appears to be central to the initiation of escape behavior: na{\"{i}}ve animals remotely injected with epinephrine immediately increased flight initiation distance, whereas those injected with corticosterone did not. Our results provide the first evidence that muted escape behavior in predator-na{\"{i}}ve species is indicative of both a cognitive deficit in recognizing potential predators and a catecholamine deficit in response. Understanding how the response to predators differs in predator-na{\"{i}}ve species could enable the design of maximally effective techniques for inducing an anti-predator response in these vulnerable species. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We evaluated this hypothesis in a wild great tit (Parus major) population by testing the prediction that the heterozygosity-fitness association would appear in broods experimentally infested with a common ectoparasite, but not in parasite-free broods. We simultaneously assessed the effects of parental and offspring heterozygosity on nestling growth and found that body mass of nestlings close to independence, which is a strong predictor of post-fledging survival, increased significantly with nestling levels of heterozygosity in experimentally infested nests, but not in parasite-free nests. Heterozygosity level of the fathers also showed a significant positive correlation with offspring body mass under an experimental parasite load, whereas there was no correlation with the mothers' level of heterozygosity. Thus, our results indicate a key role for parasites as mediators of the heterozygosity-fitness correlations.},

	abstract = {Although believed to be extinct, the endemic Jamaican Iguana Cyclura collei Gray, was recently discovered in the Hellshire Hills on Jamaica's south coast. For the first time, nesting and hatching could be documented. In 1991, gravid females commenced trial digging of nest burrows in April, two months before egg laying. From June 15 to June 24, six females deposited their clutches at two nesting sites, both sunlit and with thick layers of soil. At one site, two females nested 13 m apart from each other, while four females nested 2-4 m apart at the second site. Spent females defended their nests against rival females over periods of 9-16 days. Three other gravid females visited the two sites but did not lay there. Clutch size (n = 4) ranged from 16-20 eggs. One clutch of 16 eggs was retrieved and incubated in captivity. Eleven hatchlings were obtained after 86-90 days of incubation. Hatchlings in the field emerged 85-87 days after egg deposition. Hatching success varied from 0{\%} to 100{\%} and appeared positively correlated with female body size. Snout-vent-length and body mass of 31 hatchlings averaged 94.9 mm (90-99 mm) and 32.8 g (24.3-36.5 g), respectively. No predation on nesting females, eggs, or hatching young was observed, perhaps because the research team protected the iguanas. The frequent presence of introduced predators and competitors such as mongooses, dogs and pigs at or near the nesting sites emphasized the importance of taking protective measures during the reproductive season.},

All individuals of an isofemale strain proved to be heteroplasmic for normal and deficient mtDNA molecules. This type of heteroplasmy resembles one observed in patients with mitochondrial myopathies but differs in that the fitness of heteroplasmic flies is not significantly reduced even though the mutant mtDNA constitutes 50-80{\%} of total mtDNA in most of the individuals studied.

@article{Vonk2013,
	abstract = {Snakes are limbless predators, and many species use venom to help overpower relatively large, agile prey. Snake venoms are complex protein mixtures encoded by several multilocus gene families that function synergistically to cause incapacitation. To examine venom evolution, we sequenced and interrogated the genome of a venomous snake, the king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah), and compared it, together with our unique transcriptome, microRNA, and proteome datasets from this species, with data from other vertebrates. In contrast to the platypus, the only other venomous vertebrate with a sequenced genome, we find that snake toxin genes evolve through several distinct co-option mechanisms and exhibit surprisingly variable levels of gene duplication and directional selection that correlate with their functional importance in prey capture. The enigmatic accessory venom gland shows a very different pattern of toxin gene expression from the main venom gland and seems to have recruited toxin-like lectin genes repeatedly for new nontoxic functions. In addition, tissue-specific microRNA analyses suggested the co-option of core genetic regulatory components of the venom secretory system from a pancreatic origin. Although the king cobra is limbless, we recovered coding sequences for all Hox genes involved in amniote limb development, with the exception of Hoxd12. Our results provide a unique view of the origin and evolution of snake venom and reveal multiple genome-level adaptive responses to natural selection in this complex biological weapon system. More generally, they provide insight into mechanisms of protein evolution under strong selection.},

	abstract = {Background and AimsThe interaction between forest fragmentation and predicted climate change may pose a serious threat to tree populations. In small and spatially isolated forest fragments, increased homozygosity may directly affect individual tree fitness through the expression of deleterious alleles. Climate change-induced drought stress may exacerbate these detrimental genetic consequences of forest fragmentation, as the fitness response to low levels of individual heterozygosity is generally thought to be stronger under environmental stress than under optimal conditions.MethodsTo test this hypothesis, a greenhouse experiment was performed in which various transpiration and growth traits of 6-month-old seedlings of Quercus robur differing in multilocus heterozygosity (MLH) were recorded for 3 months under a well-watered and a drought stress treatment. Heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFC) were examined by correlating the recorded traits of individual seedlings to their MLH and by studying their response to drought stress.Key ResultsWeak, but significant, effects of MLH on several fitness traits were obtained, which were stronger for transpiration variables than for the recorded growth traits. High atmospheric stress (measured as vapour pressure deficit) influenced the strength of the HFCs of the transpiration variables, whereas only a limited effect of the irrigation treatment on the HFCs was observed.ConclusionsUnder ongoing climate change, increased atmospheric stress in the future may strengthen the negative fitness responses of trees to low MLH. This indicates the necessity to maximize individual multilocus heterozygosity in forest tree breeding programmes.},

This phenomenon could result in the extinction of endemic species. This study aims at investigating the hybridization dynamics between the endemic and threatened Lesser Antillean iguana (Iguana delicatissima) and the invasive common green iguana (Iguana iguana) in the Lesser Antilles, as well as assessing the impact of interspecific hybridization on the decline of I. delicatissima. 59 I. delicatissima (5 localities), 47 I. iguana (12 localities) and 27 hybrids (5 localities), who were all identified based on morphological characters, have been genotyped at 15 microsatellites markers. We also sequenced hybrids using ND4 mitochondrial loci to further investigate mitochondrial introgression. The genetic clustering of species and hybrid genetic assignment were performed using a comparative approach, through the implementation of a Discriminant Analysis of Principal Component (DAPC) based on statistics, as well as genetic clustering approaches based on the genetic models of several populations (Structure, NewHybrids and HIest), in order to get full characterization of hybridization patterns and introgression dynamics across the islands. The iguanas identified as hybrids in the wild, thanks to morphological analysis, were all genetically F1, F2, or backcrosses. A high proportion of individuals were also the result of a longer-term admixture. The absence of reproductive barriers between species leads to hybridization when species are in contact. Yet morphological and behavioral differences between species could explain why males I. iguana may dominate I. delicatissima, thus resulting in short-term species displacement and extinction by hybridization and recurrent introgression from I. iguana toward I. delicatissima. As a consequence, I. delicatissima gets eliminated through introgression, as observed in recent population history over several islands. These results have profound implications for species management of the endangered I. delicatissima and practical conservation recommendations are being discussed in the light of these findings.},

	abstract = {The Larch Mountain salamander (Plethodon larselli Burns, 1954) is an endemic species in the Pacific northwestern United States facing threats related to habitat destruction. To facilitate development of conservation strategies, we used DNA sequences and RAPDs (random amplified polymorphic DNA) to examine differences among populations of this species. Phylogenetic analyses of cytochrome b revealed a clade of haplotypes from populations north of the Columbia River derived from a clade containing haplotypes from the river's southwestern region. Haplotypes from southeastern populations formed a separate clade. Nucleotide diversity was reduced in northern populations relative to southern populations. These results were corroborated by analyses of RAPD loci, which revealed similar patterns of clustering and diversity. Network analyses suggested that northern populations were colonized following a range expansion mediated by individuals from populations located southwest of the river. Changes in the Columbia River's location during the Pliocene and Pleistocene likely released distributional constraints on this species, permitting their northern range expansion. Based on the barrier presented by the Columbia River's present location and differences in haplotype diversity and population structure observed between northern and southern populations, we suggest that designation of separate management units encompassing each region may assist with mitigating different threats to this species.},

Effective conservation and management of the Scandinavian brown bear requires knowledge of the current levels of genetic diversity and gene flow among the four subpopulations. Earlier studies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity revealed extremely low levels of genetic variation, and population structure that grouped the three northern subpopulations in one genetic clade and the southernmost subpopulation in a second highly divergent clade. In this study, we extended the analysis of genetic diversity and gene flow in the Scandinavian brown bear using data from 19 nuclear DNA microsatellite loci. Results from the nuclear loci were strikingly different than the mtDNA results. Genetic diversity levels in the four subpopulations were equivalent to diversity levels in nonbottlenecked populations from North America, and significantly higher than levels in other bottlenecked and isolated brown bear populations. Gene flow levels between subpopulations ranged from low to moderate and were correlated with geographical distance. The substantial difference in results obtained using mtDNA and nuclear DNA markers stresses the importance of collecting data from both types of genetic markers before interpreting data and making recommendations for the conservation and management of natural populations. Based on the results from the mtDNA and nuclear DNA data sets, we propose one evolutionarily significant unit and four management units for the brown bear in Scandinavia.},

	abstract = {Two closely related Hipparchia taxa, Hipparchia delattini Kudrna, 1975 and H. semele muelleri Kudrna, 1975 have been described from the Balkans based on differences in male genital structure, compared to each other and to another nominal European taxon (H. semele Linnaeus, 1758). Subsequently, Kudrna (1977) synonymised both H. delattini and H. muelleri with H. volgensis (Mazochin-Porshnjakov, 1952). Application of multivariate statistical techniques on male genital data indicates a cline in several aspects of genital morphology linking these three taxa across Europe. Although clusters are repeatedly found that correspond with the three taxa, it is not possible to ascribe every individual specimen to one of the three Hipparchia taxa. Hipparchia muelleri is shown to occupy an intermediate position between H. semele and H. delattini. Generally, H. delattini is present in an area covering part of northern Greece and the central Balkans. H. semele is present in western Europe, the Balkans and down the western side of Greece. However, individual specimens that classify to H. delattini in the current analyses may occur much further west, where historically only H. semele has been, and there appears to be a correlation between putative taxa and altitude with H. delattini occurring at higher altitudes. It is suggested that genetic differentiation between these taxa has been maintained and enhanced during glacial-interglacial cycles. The results of this study are discussed in relation to other morphological characters and biogeography and require further testing with molecular data.},

	abstract = {Abstract Background Understanding the fitness consequences of inbreeding is of major importance for evolutionary and conservation biology. However, there are few studies using pedigree-based estimates of inbreeding or investigating the influence of environment and age variation on inbreeding depression in natural populations. Here we investigated the consequences of variation in inbreeding coefficient for three juvenile traits, birth date, birth weight and first year survival, in a wild population of red deer, considering both calf and mother's inbreeding coefficient. We also tested whether inbreeding depression varied with environmental conditions and maternal age. Results We detected non-zero inbreeding coefficients for 22{\%} of individuals with both parents and at least one grandparent known (increasing to 42{\%} if the dataset was restricted to those with four known grandparents). Inbreeding depression was evident for birth weight and first year survival but not for birth date: the first year survival of offspring with an inbreeding coefficient of 0.25 was reduced by 77{\%} compared to offspring with an inbreeding coefficient of zero. However, it was independent of measures of environmental variation and maternal age. The effect of inbreeding on birth weight appeared to be driven by highly inbred individuals (F = 0.25). On the other hand first year survival showed strong inbreeding depression that was not solely driven by individuals with the highest inbreeding coefficients, corresponding to an estimate of 4.35 lethal equivalents. Conclusions These results represent a rare demonstration of inbreeding depression using pedigree-based estimates in a wild mammal population and highlight the potential strength of effects on key components of fitness.},

	abstract = {In nature, individuals vary tremendously in condition and this may be an important source of variation in mutation rate. Condition is likely to affect cell state and thereby impact the amount of DNA damage sustained and/or the way it is repaired. Here, we focus on DNA repair. If low-condition individuals are less capable of devoting the same level of resources to accurate repair, they may suffer higher mutation rates. However, repair decisions are also governed by various aspects of cell physiology, which may render the prediction that "higher-condition individuals use better repair mechanisms" too simplistic. We use a larval diet manipulation in Drosophila melanogaster to create high- and low-condition individuals and then contrast their relative usage of three repair pathways [homologous recombination (HR), single-strand annealing (SSA), and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ)] that differ in their mechanistic requirements and their mutational consequences. We find that low-condition flies are more likely than high-condition flies to use the most conservative of these three repair pathways, suggesting that physiological constraints on repair pathway usage may be more important than energetic costs. We also show that the repair differences between high- and low-condition flies resemble those between young and old flies, suggesting the underlying mechanisms may be similar. Finally, we observe that the effect of larval diet on adult repair increases as flies age, indicating that developmental differences early in life can have long-lasting consequences.},

Both environment and genetic background affected selection on individual mutations.

	abstract = {Allelic dropout is a commonly observed source of missing data in microsatellite genotypes, in which one or both allelic copies at a locus fail to be amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. Especially for samples with poor DNA quality, this problem causes a downward bias in estimates of observed heterozygosity and an upward bias in estimates of inbreeding, owing to mistaken classifications of heterozygotes as homozygotes when one of the two copies drops out. One general approach for avoiding allelic dropout involves repeated genotyping of homozygous loci to minimize the effects of experimental error. Existing computational alternatives often require replicate genotyping as well. These approaches, however, are costly and are suitable only when enough DNA is available for repeated genotyping. In this study, we propose a maximum-likelihood approach together with an expectation-maximization algorithm to jointly estimate allelic dropout rates and allele frequencies when only one set of nonreplicated genotypes is available. Our method considers estimates of allelic dropout caused by both sample-specific factors and locus-specific factors, and it allows for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium owing to inbreeding. Using the estimated parameters, we correct the bias in the estimation of observed heterozygosity through the use of multiple imputations of alleles in cases where dropout might have occurred. With simulated data, we show that our method can (1) effectively reproduce patterns of missing data and heterozygosity observed in real data; (2) correctly estimate model parameters, including sample-specific dropout rates, locus-specific dropout rates, and the inbreeding coefficient; and (3) successfully correct the downward bias in estimating the observed heterozygosity. We find that our method is fairly robust to violations of model assumptions caused by population structure and by genotyping errors from sources other than allelic dropout. Because the data sets imputed under our model can be investigated in additional subsequent analyses, our method will be useful for preparing data for applications in diverse contexts in population genetics and molecular ecology.},

However, landscape genetics still lacks a framework for quantifying the effects of landscape features, such as habitat type, on realized gene flow. Here, we present a methodology for identifying the costs of dispersal through different habitats for the California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense), an endangered species restricted to grassland/vernal pool habitat mosaics. We sampled larvae from all 16 breeding ponds in a geographically restricted area of vernal pool habitat at the Fort Ord Natural Reserve, Monterey County, California. We estimated between-pond gene flow using 13 polymorphic microsatellite loci and constructed GIS data layers of habitat types in our study area. We then used least-cost path analysis to determine the relative costs of movement through each habitat that best match rates of gene flow measured by our genetic data. We identified four measurable rates of gene flow between pairs of ponds, with between 10.5{\%} and 19.9{\%} of larvae having immigrant ancestry. Although A. californiense is typically associated with breeding ponds in grassland habitat, we found that dispersal through grassland is nearly twice as costly as dispersal through chaparral and that oak woodland is by far the most costly habitat to traverse. With the increasing availability of molecular resources and GIS data, we anticipate that these methods could be applied to a broad range of study systems, particularly those with cryptic life histories that make direct observation of movement challenging.},

	abstract = {Stochastic simulations were run to compare the effects of nine breeding schemes, using full-sib mating, on the rate of purging of inbreeding depression due to mutations with equal deleterious effect on viability at unlinked loci in an outbred population. A number of full-sib mating lines were initiated from a large outbred population and maintained for 20 generations (if not extinct). Selection against deleterious mutations was allowed to occur within lines only, between lines or equal within and between lines, and surviving lines were either not crossed or crossed following every one or three generations of full-sib mating. The effectiveness of purging was indicated by the decreased number of lethal equivalents and the increased fitness of the purged population formed from crossing surviving lines after 20 generations under a given breeding scheme. The results show that the effectiveness of purging, the survival of the inbred lines and the inbreeding level attained are generally highest with between-line selection and lowest with within-line selection. Compared with no crossing, line crossing could lower the risk of extinction and the inbreeding coefficient of the purged population substantially with little loss of the effectiveness of purging. Compromising between the effectiveness of purging, and the risk of extinction and inbreeding coefficient, the breeding scheme with equal within- and between-line selection and crossing alternatively with full-sib mating is generally the most desirable scheme for purging deleterious mutations. Unless most deleterious mutations have relatively large effects on fitness in species with reproductive ability high enough to cope with the depressed fitness and thus increased risk of extinction with inbreeding, it is not justified to apply a breeding programme aimed at purging inbreeding depression by inbreeding and selection to a population of conservation concern.},

	abstract = {A multilocus stochastic model is developed to simulate the dynamics of mutational load in small populations of various sizes. Old mutations sampled from a large ancestral population at mutation-selection balance and new mutations arising each generation are considered jointly, using biologically plausible lethal and deleterious mutation parameters. The results show that inbreeding depression and the number of lethal equivalents due to partially recessive mutations can be partly purged from the population by inbreeding, and that this purging mainly involves lethals or detrimentals of large effect. However, fitness decreases continuously with inbreeding, due to increased fixation and homozygosity of mildly deleterious mutants, resulting in extinctions of very small populations with low reproductive rates. No optimum inbreeding rate or population size exists for purging with respect to fitness (viability) changes, but there is an optimum inbreeding rate at a given final level of inbreeding for reducing inbreeding depression or the number of lethal equivalents. The interaction between selection against partially recessive mutations and genetic drift in small populations also influences the rate of decay of neutral variation. Weak selection against mutants relative to genetic drift results in apparent overdominance and thus an increase in effective size (Ne) at neutral loci, and strong selection relative to drift leads to a decrease in Ne due to the increased variance in family size. The simulation results and their implications are discussed in the context of biological conservation and tests for purging.},

It is, however, notoriously difficult to estimate, mainly because of the highly stochastic nature of the processes of inbreeding and genetic drift for which Ne is usually defined and measured, and because of the many factors (such as time and spatial scales, systematic forces) confounding such processes. Many methods have been developed in the past three decades to estimate the current, past and ancient effective population sizes using different information extracted from some genetic markers in a sample of individuals. This paper reviews the methodologies proposed for estimating Ne from genetic data using information on heterozygosity excess, linkage disequilibrium, temporal changes in allele frequency, and pattern and amount of genetic variation within and between populations. For each methodology, I describe mainly the logic and genetic model on which it is based, the data required and information used, the interpretation of the estimate obtained, some results from applications to simulated or empirical datasets and future developments that are needed.},

	abstract = {Endangered species are commonly found in several (partially) isolated populations dispersed on different fragments of a habitat, natural reserve, or zoo. A certain level of connectivity among such populations is essential for maintaining genetic variation within and between populations to allow local and global adaptation and for preventing inbreeding depression. A rule of thumb widely accepted by the conservation community is that one migrant per generation (OMPG) into a population is the appropriate level of gene flow. This rule is based on Wright's study of his island model under a long list of simplifying assumptions. I examined the robustness of the OMPG rule to the violation of each of the many assumptions, quantifying the effect with population genetics theory. I showed that, when interpreted as one effective migrant per generation, OMPG is generally valid for real populations departing from the ideal model in the discrepancies of actual (N) and effective (N-e) population sizes and actual (m) and effective (m(e)) migration rates. I also addressed the issue of converting the effective number of migrants (M-e = N(e)m(e)) into the actual-number of migrants (M = Nm) of a certain age and sex. In particular, N-e {\textless} N, a case common for natural populations, did not necessarily require M {\textgreater} M-e to maintain a certain level of differentiation among populations. Rather, translating the elusive M-e into the manageable M depends on the specific causes (e.g., biased sex ratio, reproductive skew) that lead to N-e {\textless} N.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity assessment of marine hard-bottom communities is hindered by the high diversity and size-ranges of the organisms present. Wedeveloped aDNAmetabarcoding protocol for biodiversity characterization of structurally complex natural marine hardbottom communities. We used two molecular markers: the ``Leray fragment'' of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COI), for which a novel primer set was developed, and the V7 region of the nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA (18S). Eight different shallow marine littoral communities from two National Parks in Spain (one in the Atlantic Ocean and another in the Mediterranean Sea) were studied. Samples were sieved into three size fractions from where DNA was extracted separately. Bayesian clustering was used for delimiting molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) and custom reference databases were constructed for taxonomic assignment. Despite applying stringent filters, we found high values for MOTU richness (2,510 and 9,679 MOTUs with 18S and COI, respectively), suggesting that these communities host a large amount of yet undescribed eukaryotic biodiversity. Significant gaps are still found in sequence reference databases, which currently prevent the complete taxonomic assignment of the detected sequences. In our dataset, 85{\%} of 18S MOTUs and 64{\%} of COI MOTUs could be identified to phylum or lower taxonomic level. Nevertheless, those unassigned were mostly rare MOTUs with low numbers of reads, and assigned MOTUs comprised over 90{\%} of the total sequence reads. The identification rate might be significantly improved in the future, as reference databases are further completed. Our results show that marine metabarcoding, currently applied mostly to plankton or sediments, can be adapted to structurally complex hard bottom samples. Thus, eukaryotic metabarcoding emerges as a robust, fast, objective and affordable method to comprehensively characterize the diversity of marine benthic communities dominated by macroscopic seaweeds and colonial or modular sessile metazoans. The 18S marker lacks species-level resolution and thus cannot be recommended to assess the detailed taxonomic composition of these communities. Our new universal primers for COI can potentially be used for biodiversity assessment with high taxonomic resolution in a wide array of marine, terrestrial or freshwater eukaryotic communities.},

	abstract = {Although standard statistical tests (such as contingency chi-square or G tests) are not well suited to the analysis of temporal changes in allele frequencies, they continue to be used routinely in this context. Because the null hypothesis stipulated by the test is violated if samples are temporally spaced, the true probability of a significant test statistic will not equal the nominal a level, and conclusions drawn on the basis of such tests can be misleading. A generalized method, applicable to a wide variety of organisms and sampling schemes, is developed here to estimate the probability of a significant test statistic if the only forces acting on allele frequencies are stochastic ones (i.e., sampling error and genetic drift). Results from analyses and simulations indicate that the rate at which this probability increases with time is determined primarily by the ratio of sample size to effective population size. Because this ratio differs considerably among species, the seri- ousness of the error in using the standard test will also differ. Bias is particularly strong in cases in which a high percentage of the total population can be sampled (for example, endangered species). The model used here is also applicable to the analysis of parent-offspring data and to comparisons of replicate samples from the same generation. A generalized test of the hypothesis that observed changes in allele frequency can be satisfactorily explained by drift follows directly from the model, and simulation results indicate that the true a level of this adjusted test is close to the nominal one under most condition},

Whereas previous treatments of this method have adopted rather limiting assumptions, the present analysis shows that the temporal method is generally applicable to a wide variety of organisms. Use of a revised model of gene sampling permits a more generalized interpretation of Ne than that used by some other authors studying this method. It is shown that two sampling plans (individuals for genetic analysis taken before or after reproduction) whose differences have been stressed by previous authors can be treated in a uniform way. Computer simulations using a wide variety of initial conditions show that different formulas for computing F have much less effect on Ne than do sample size (S), number of generations between samples (t), or the number of loci studied (L). Simulation results also indicate that (1) bias of F is small unless alleles with very low frequency are used; (2) precision is typically increased by about the same amount with a doubling of S, t, or L; (3) confidence intervals for Ne computed using a chi 2 approximation are accurate and unbiased under most conditions; (4) the temporal method is best suited for use with organisms having high juvenile mortality and, perhaps, a limited effective population size.},

	abstract = {We review commonly used population definitions under both the ecological paradigm (which emphasizes demographic cohesion) and the evolutionary paradigm (which emphasizes reproductive cohesion) and find that none are truly operational. We suggest several quantitative criteria that might be used to determine when groups of individuals are different enough to be considered 'populations'. Units for these criteria are migration rate (m) for the ecological paradigm and migrants per generation (Nm) for the evolutionary paradigm. These criteria are then evaluated by applying analytical methods to simulated genetic data for a finite island model. Under the standard parameter set that includes L = 20 High mutation (microsatellite-like) loci and samples of S = 50 individuals from each of n = 4 subpopulations, power to detect departures from panmixia was very high ( approximately 100{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001) even with high gene flow (Nm = 25). A new method, comparing the number of correct population assignments with the random expectation, performed as well as a multilocus contingency test and warrants further consideration. Use of Low mutation (allozyme-like) markers reduced power more than did halving S or L. Under the standard parameter set, power to detect restricted gene flow below a certain level X (H(0): Nm {\textless} X) can also be high, provided that true Nm {\textless} or = 0.5X. Developing the appropriate test criterion, however, requires assumptions about several key parameters that are difficult to estimate in most natural populations. Methods that cluster individuals without using a priori sampling information detected the true number of populations only under conditions of moderate or low gene flow (Nm {\textless} or = 5), and power dropped sharply with smaller samples of loci and individuals. A simple algorithm based on a multilocus contingency test of allele frequencies in pairs of samples has high power to detect the true number of populations even with Nm = 25 but requires more rigorous statistical evaluation. The ecological paradigm remains challenging for evaluations using genetic markers, because the transition from demographic dependence to independence occurs in a region of high migration where genetic methods have relatively little power. Some recent theoretical developments and continued advances in computational power provide hope that this situation may change in the future.},

In particular, for species with overlapping generations, it is easier to estimate the effective number of breeders in one reproductive cycle (Nb) than Ne per generation. We empirically evaluated the relationship between life history and ratios of Ne, Nb and adult census size (N) using a recently developed model (agene) and published vital rates for 63 iteroparous animals and plants. Nb/Ne varied a surprising sixfold across species and, contrary to expectations, Nb was larger than Ne in over half the species. Up to two-thirds of the variance in Nb/Ne and up to half the variance in Ne/N was explained by just two life-history traits (age at maturity and adult lifespan) that have long interested both ecologists and evolutionary biologists. These results provide novel insights into, and demonstrate a close general linkage between, demographic and evolutionary processes across diverse taxa. For the first time, our results also make it possible to interpret rapidly accumulating estimates of Nb in the context of the rich body of evolutionary theory based on Ne per generation.},

	abstract = {The U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) considers "distinct" populations of vertebrates to be "species" (and hence eligible for legal protection) but does not explain how distinctness should be evaluated. A review of the legislative and legal history of the ESA indicates that in implementing the ESA with respect to vertebrate populations, the Fish and Wildlife Senice and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) should strive to conserve genetic diversity scientifically but sparingly. Based on these precepts, NMFS developed a species policy to guide ESA listing determinations for Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. According to the policy, a population (or group of populations) will be considered distinct if it represents an evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) of the biological species. The unifying theme of the NMFS species policy is the desire to identify and conserve important genetic resources in nature, thus allowing the dynamic process of evolutioa to continue largely unaffected by human factors. A review of case histories in which the NMFS policy has been applied shows that it is flexible enough to provide guidance on many difficult issues for Pacific salmon, such as anadromy versus nonanadromy, variation in life history patterns, and the role of hatchery fish in regards to the ESA. Collectively, these case studies also provide insight into approaches for dealing with scientific uncertainty. Some criticisms of the ESU concept (e.g., that it is too subjective and relies too much-or not enough-on genetics) are discussed, as is its applicability to biological conservation outside the ESA.

Life-history allocation models typically assume that "bigger offspring are better", but field data paint a more complex picture: larger offspring size sometimes enhances fitness, and sometimes not. Additionally, higher survival and faster growth of larger offspring might be due to indirect maternal effects (e.g., mothers allocate hormones or nutrients differently to different-sized eggs), and not to offspring size per se. Alternative factors, such as seasonal timing of hatching, may be more important. We examined these issues using 419 eggs from captive jacky dragon lizards (Amphibolurus muricatus). The mothers were maintained under standardized conditions to minimize variance in thermal and nutritional history, and the eggs were incubated under controlled conditions to minimize variance in offspring phenotypes due to incubation temperature and moisture. We reduced the size of half the eggs (and, thus, the size of the resultant hatchlings) from each clutch by yolk extraction. The hatchlings were marked and released at a field site over a 3-month period, with regular recapture surveys to measure growth and survival under natural conditions. Growth rates and survival were strongly enhanced by early-season hatching, but were not affected by hatchling body size.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a case is made for the use of model-based approaches for the analysis of commu- nity data. This involves the direct specification of a statistical model for the observed multivariate data. Recent advances in statistical modelling mean that it is now possible to build models that are appropriate for the data which address key ecological questions in a statistically coherent manner. Key advantages of this approach include interpretability, flexibility, and effi- ciency, which we explain in detail and illustrate by example. The steps in a model-based approach to analysis are outlined, with an emphasis on key features arising in a multivariate context. A key distinction in the model-based approach is the emphasis on diagnostic checking to ensure that the model provides reasonable agreement with the observed data. Two examples are presented that illustrate how the model- based approach can provide insights into ecological problems not previously available. In the first exam- ple, we test for a treatment effect in a study where different sites had different sampling intensities, which was handled by adding an offset term to the model. In the second example, we incorporate trait information into a model for ordinal response in order to identify the main reasons why species differ in their environmental response.},

	abstract = {A critical summary of count data is its mean-variance relationship, yet this is rarely considered in multivariate analysis in ecology. This study considers what is being implicitly assumed about the mean-variance relationship in distance-based analyses - multivariate analyses based on a matrix of pairwise distances - and what the effect is of any misspecification of the mean-variance relationship. It is known that distance-based analyses make implicit assumptions that are typically out-of-step with what is observed in real data, which has major consequences. Potential consequences of this mean-variance misspecifiation are: confounding location and dispersion effects in ordinations; misleading results when trying to identify taxa in which an effect is expressed; failure to detect a multivariate effect unless it is expressed in high-variance taxa. Data transformation does not solve the problem. A solution is to use generalized linear models and their recent multivariate generalisations, which is shown here to have desirable properties.},

	abstract = {Parasites are considered drivers of population regulation in some species; unfortunately the research leading to this hypothesis has all been conducted on managed populations. Still unclear is whether parasites have population-level effects in truly wild populations and what life-history traits drive observed virulence. A meta-analysis of 38 data sets where parasite loads were altered on non-domesticated, free-ranging wild vertebrate hosts (31 birds, 6 mammals, 1 fish) was conducted and found a strong negative effect of parasites at the population-level (g= 0.49). Among different categories of response variables measured, parasites significantly affected clutch size, hatching success, young produced, and survival, but not overall breeding success. A meta-regression of effect sizes and life-history traits thought to determine parasite virulence indicate that average host life span may be the single most important driver for understanding the effects of parasites. Further studies, especially of long-lived hosts, are necessary to prove this hypothesis. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

	abstract = {A fundamental result of population genetics states that a new mutation, at an unlinked neutral locus in a randomly mating diploid population, has a mean time of fixation of ∼4N(e) generations, where N(e) is the effective population size. This result is based on an assumption of fixed population size, which does not universally hold in natural populations. Here, we analyze such neutral fixations in populations of changing size within the framework of the diffusion approximation. General expressions are derived for the mean and variance of the fixation time in changing populations. Some explicit results are given for two cases: (i) the effective population size undergoes a sudden change, representing a sudden population expansion or a sudden bottleneck; (ii) the effective population changes linearly for a limited period of time and then remains constant. Additionally, a lower bound for the mean time of fixation is obtained for an effective population size that increases with time, and this is applied to exponentially growing populations. The results obtained in this work show, among other things, that for populations that increase in size, the mean time of fixation can be enhanced, sometimes substantially so, over 4N(e,0) generations, where N(e,0) is the effective population size at the time the mutation arises. Such an enhancement is associated with (i) an increased probability of neutral polymorphism in a population and (ii) an enhanced persistence of high-frequency neutral variation, which is the variation most likely to be observed.},

	abstract = {The effects of inter--- and intraspecific interference on size hierarchies (size inequalities) were investigated in populations of the annual plants Trifolium incarnatum and Lolium multiflorum. Variables experimentally manipulated included plant density, species proportions, soil fertility, and spatial pattern of plantings. Densities were below those for extensive density---dependent mortality. Size inequality always increased with increasing density. Plants grown individually showed very low inequality, while plants grown at the highest density had the most developed hierarchies. Size inequality usually increased with an increase in productivity when interference was occurring. When dominant in mixtures, Lolium showed less size inequality than in monoculture, while the suppressed species, Trifolium, usually displayed an increase in inequality. Spatial pattern appeared to be less important than other factors in causing size inequalities; plants sown in a uniform spatial pattern showed significantly lower size inequality than plants sown in a random pattern in only one out of four cases. Inequality in reproductive output of Trifolium, as estimated by dry mass of flower heads, was always greater than inequality in plant in dry mass. The results support a model of plant interference in which large plants are able to usurp resources and suppress the growth of smaller individuals more than they themselves are suppressed. While interference decreases mean plant mass, it increases both relative variation in plant mass and the concentration of mass within a small fraction of the population.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rickettsia are intracellular symbionts of eukaryotes that are best known for infecting and causing serious diseases in humans and other mammals. All known vertebrate-associated Rickettsia are vectored by arthropods as part of their life-cycle, and many other Rickettsia are found exclusively in arthropods with no known secondary host. However, little is known about the biology of these latter strains. Here, we have identified 20 new strains of Rickettsia from arthropods, and constructed a multi-gene phylogeny of the entire genus which includes these new strains. RESULTS: We show that Rickettsia are primarily arthropod-associated bacteria, and identify several novel groups within the genus. Rickettsia do not co-speciate with their hosts but host shifts most often occur between related arthropods. Rickettsia have evolved adaptations including transmission through vertebrates and killing males in some arthropod hosts. We uncovered one case of horizontal gene transfer among Rickettsia, where a strain is a chimera from two distantly related groups, but multi-gene analysis indicates that different parts of the genome tend to share the same phylogeny. CONCLUSION: Approximately 150 million years ago, Rickettsia split into two main clades, one of which primarily infects arthropods, and the other infects a diverse range of protists, other eukaryotes and arthropods. There was then a rapid radiation about 50 million years ago, which coincided with the evolution of life history adaptations in a few branches of the phylogeny. Even though Rickettsia are thought to be primarily transmitted vertically, host associations are short lived with frequent switching to new host lineages. Recombination throughout the genus is generally uncommon, although there is evidence of horizontal gene transfer. A better understanding of the evolution of Rickettsia will help in the future to elucidate the mechanisms of pathogenicity, transmission and virulence.},

	abstract = {For species living in naturally fragmented habitats, the identification of conservation units is particularly challenging. Turks and Caicos Rock Iguanas, Cyclura carinata, are endemic to the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI). These Critically Endangered lizards inhabit less than 5{\%} of their historic range. A complete study of the geographic distribution of genetic variation is now particularly important for this species due to the onset of translocation programs. To fill this knowledge gap, we genotyped 280 individuals from 30 sampling locations across the species range were genotyped at 29 microsatellite loci, and variation within the mitochondrial ND4 gene was assessed by sequencing, or the use of PCR-RFLPs. A protein profiling analysis of femoral pore secretions was also conducted on a subset of samples. Microsatellites suggest that a recent, common population ancestry, or a simple reduction in gene flow, cannot account for the significant differences detected between a western and an eastern lineage within the TCI (Fct = 0.202, p ≪ 0.01). The same pattern was confirmed by mitochondrial DNA sequence, significantly distinguishing between the western and eastern haplotypes ($\Phi$ct = 0.96, p ≪ 0.01). Protein profiling provides further support, differentiating a western and eastern lineage. Implications of these results are that at least two evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) can be recognized across this taxon's geographic range. Multiple management units, within each ESU, can also be defined. Future management planning for C. carinata should consider these evolutionarily independent lineages.},

	abstract = {Epigenetic modification of cytosine methylation states can be elicited by environmental stresses and may be a key process affecting phenotypic plasticity and adaptation. Parasites are potent stressors with profound physiological and ecological effects on their host, but there is little understanding in how parasites may influence host methylation states. Here, we estimate epigenetic diversity and differentiation among 21 populations of red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica) in north-east Scotland and test for association of gastrointestinal parasite load (caecal nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis) with hepatic genome-wide and locus-specific methylation states. Following methylation-sensitive AFLP (MSAP), 129 bands, representing 73 methylation-susceptible and 56 nonmethylated epiloci, were scored across 234 individuals. The populations differed significantly in genome-wide methylation levels and were also significantly epigenetically (F(SC) = 0.0227; P {\textless} 0.001) and genetically (F(SC) = 0.0058; P {\textless} 0.001) differentiated. Parasite load was not associated with either genome-wide methylation levels or epigenetic differentiation. Instead, we found eight disproportionately differentiated epilocus-specific methylation states (F(ST) outliers) using bayescan software and significant positive and negative association of 35 methylation states with parasite load from bespoke generalized estimating equations (GEE), simple logistic regression (sam) and Bayesian environmental analysis (bayenv2). Following Sanger sequencing, genome mapping and geneontology (go) annotation, some of these epiloci were linked to genes involved in regulation of cell cycle, signalling, metabolism, immune system and notably rRNA methylation, histone acetylation and small RNAs. These findings demonstrate an epigenetic signature of parasite load in populations of a wild bird and suggest intriguing physiological effects of parasite-associated cytosine methylation.},

	abstract = {Females from good habitats not only lay larger clutches but also maintain higher proportions of reserves for survival during harsh conditions. Thousands of females use the island's caldera for nesting. They may migrate distances {\textgreater}10 km to the 1495-m high summit and finally climb into the 900-m deep caldera for nesting. Migration costs are accordingly high and constitute half the reproductive effort. If migration costs are added to the clutch weight the corresponding value is between the mean and maximum for other lizards. The value is unexpectedly high for a long-lived species controlled by resources (adults). The expenditure per egg is low, presumably an adaptation to the extreme predation pressure at and shortly after hatching. The high investment and associated risks to reach the caldera must be counterbalanced by advantages of nesting there. Three possibilities are discussed. 1) Climatic conditions in the caldera may enable the population to place egg production and mating in the most favorable (warm, rainy) season; 2) nests were found in fumarole-heated soil which could be used to concentrate hatching into a much shorter period than laying (an antipredator mechanism); 3) sex determination on the basis of incubation temperature. -from Author},

These processes will tend to reduce genetic diversity within populations and reduce individual heterozygosities because of genetic drift, inbreeding and reduced migration. Conservation biologists need to know the effect of population size on genetic diversity, as this is likely to influence a population's ability to persist. Island populations represent an ideal natural experiment with which to study this problem. In a study of common shrews (Sorex araneus) on offshore Scottish islands, 497 individuals from 13 islands of different sizes and 6 regions on the mainland were trapped and genotyped at eight microsatellite loci. Previous genetic work had revealed that most of the islands in this study were highly genetically divergent from one another and the mainland. We found that most of the islands exhibited lower genetic diversity than the mainland populations. In the island populations, mean expected heterozygosity, mean observed heterozygosity and mean allelic richness were significantly positively correlated with log island size and log population size, which were estimated using habitat population density data and application of a Geographic Information System.},

Magmas erupted from the large western volcanoes are generally moderately fractionated tholeiites of uniform composition; those erupted on other islands are compositionally diverse, ranging from tholeiites to picritic basanitoids. Isotope and incompatible element ratios define a horseshoe pattern with the most depleted signatures in the center of the Galapagos Archipelago and the more enriched signatures on the eastern, northern, and southern periphery. These isotope and incompatible element patterns appear to reflect thermal entrainment of asthenosphere by the Galapagos plume as it experiences velocity shear in the uppermost asthenosphere. Both north-south heterogeneity within the plume itself and regional variations in degree and depth of melting also affect magma compositions. -from Authors},

	abstract = {Comparative microevolutionary studies of multiple parasites occurring on a single host species can help shed light on the processes underlying parasite diversification. We compared the phylogeographical histories, population genetic structures and population divergence times of three co-distributed and phylogenetically independent ectoparasitic insect species, including an amblyceran and an ischnoceran louse (Insecta: Phthiraptera), a hippoboscid fly (Insecta: Diptera) and their endemic avian host in the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Islands. The Gal{\'{a}}pagos hawk (Aves: Falconiformes: Buteo galapagoensis) is a recently arrived endemic lineage in the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Islands and its island populations are diverging evolutionarily. Each parasite species differed in relative dispersal ability and distribution within the host populations, which allowed us to make predictions about their degree of population genetic structure and whether they tracked host gene flow and colonization history among islands. To control for DNA region in comparisons across these phylogenetically distant taxa, we sequenced {\~{}}1 kb of homologous mitochondrial DNA from samples collected from all island populations of the host. Remarkably, the host was invariant across mitochondrial regions that were comparatively variable in each of the parasite species, to degrees consistent with differences in their natural histories. Differences in these natural history traits were predictably correlated with the evolutionary trajectories of each parasite species, including rates of interisland gene flow and tracking of hosts by parasites. Congruence between the population structures of the ischnoceran louse and the host suggests that the ischnoceran may yield insight into the cryptic evolutionary history of its endangered host, potentially aiding in its conservation management.},

Although they should be conserved for their own sake, past arguments, highlighting the intrinsic and utilitarian value of parasites, have not translated into increased attention by scientists or conservation managers, at least by the standard of listing for protection. Here, the use of estimated genealogies and population genetic patterns of parasites to illuminate their hosts' evolutionary and demographic history is advocated. ParasiteDNAgenerally evolvesmore rapidly than their hosts',which renders it an underexploited resource for conservation biologists, particularly in cases where the hosts' genealogy or degree of population genetic structure is difficult to measure directly.Moreover, parasite gene flow may occur during host dispersal irrespective of host gene flow, revealing host movement through space and time. Parasite ecology and evolution may thus become another tool for the management of endangered vertebrate populations. This will result in the recognition of new host records, parasite species and cryptic lineages, which will help lift the veil of ignorance with respect to parasite biodiversity. Parasites},

	abstract = {With a small effective population size, random genetic drift is more important than selection in determining the fate of new alleles. Small populations therefore accumulate deleterious mutations. Left unchecked, the effect of these fixed alleles is to reduce the reproductive capacity of a species, eventually to the point of extinction. New beneficial mutations, if fixed by selection, can restore some of this lost fitness. This paper derives the overall change in fitness due to fixation of new deleterious and beneficial alleles, as a function of the distribution of effects of new mutations and the effective population size. There is a critical effective size below which a population will on average decline in fitness, but above which beneficial mutations allow the population to persist. With reasonable estimates of the relevant parameters, this critical effective size is likely to be a few hundred. Furthermore, sexual selection can act to reduce the fixation probability of deleterious new mutations and increase the probability of fixing new beneficial mutations. Sexual selection can therefore reduce the risk of extinction of small populations.},

	abstract = {Two factors that can affect genetic load, synergistic epistasis and sexual selection, were investigated in Drosophila melanogaster. A set of five chromosomal regions containing visible recessive mutations were put together in all combinations to create a full set of 32 homozygous lines fixed for different numbers of known mutations. Two measures of fitness were made for each line: productivity (a combined measure of fecundity and egg-to-adult survivorship) and competitive male mating success. Productivity, but not male mating success, showed a pattern of strong average synergistic epistasis, such that the log fitness declined nonlinearly with increasing numbers of mutations. Synergistic epistasis is known to reduce the mutation load. Both fitness components show some positive and some negative interactions between specific sets of mutations. Furthermore, alleles with deleterious effects on productivity tend to also diminish male mating success. Given that male mating success can affect relative fitness without changing the mean productivity of a population, these additional effects would lead to lower frequencies and lower fixation rates of deleterious alleles without higher costs to the mean fitness of the population.},

These measures are variants of FST, a standardized measure of the genetic variance among populations, and are used to solve for Nm, the number of migrants successfully entering a population per generation. Unfortunately, the mathematical model underlying this translation makes many biologically unrealistic assumptions; real populations are very likely to violate these assumptions, such that there is often limited quantitative information to be gained about dispersal from using gene frequency data. While studies of genetic structure per se are often worthwhile, and FST is an excellent measure of the extent of this population structure, it is rare that FST can be translated into an accurate estimate of Nm.},

	abstract = {Healthy males are likely to have higher mating success than unhealthy males because of differential expression of condition-dependent traits such as mate searching intensity, fighting ability, display vigor, and some types of exaggerated morphological characters. We therefore expect that most new mutations that are deleterious for overall fitness may also be deleterious for male mating success. From this perspective, sexual selection is not limited to influencing those genes directly involved in exaggerated morphological traits but rather affects most, if not all, genes in the genome. If true, sexual selection can be an important force acting to reduce the frequency of deleterious mutations and, as a result, mutation load. We review the literature and find various forms of indirect evidence that sexual selection helps to eliminate deleterious mutations. However, direct evidence is scant, and there are almost no data available to address a key issue: is selection in males stronger than selection in females? In addition, the total effect of sexual selection on mutation load is complicated by possible increases in mutation rate that may be attributable to sexual selection. Finally, sexual selection affects population fitness not only through mutation load but also through sexual conflict, making it difficult to empirically measure how sexual selection affects load. Several lines of enquiry are suggested to better fill large gaps in our understanding of sexual selection and its effect on genetic load.},

	abstract = {Microsatellites are widely used in genetic analyses, many of which require reliable estimates of microsatellite mutation rates, yet the factors determining mutation rates are uncertain. The most straightforward and conclusive method by which to study mutation is direct observation of allele transmissions in parent-child pairs, and studies of this type suggest a positive, possibly exponential, relationship between mutation rate and allele size, together with a bias toward length increase. Except for microsatellites on the Y chromosome, however, previous analyses have not made full use of available data and may have introduced bias: mutations have been identified only where child genotypes could not be generated by transmission from parents' genotypes, so that the probability that a mutation is detected depends on the distribution of allele lengths and varies with allele length. We introduce a likelihood-based approach that has two key advantages over existing methods. First, we can make formal comparisons between competing models of microsatellite evolution; second, we obtain asymptotically unbiased and efficient parameter estimates. Application to data composed of 118,866 parent-offspring transmissions of AC microsatellites supports the hypothesis that mutation rate increases exponentially with microsatellite length, with a suggestion that contractions become more likely than expansions as length increases. This would lead to a stationary distribution for allele length maintained by mutational balance. There is no evidence that contractions and expansions differ in their step size distributions.},

	abstract = {Squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes) are one of the most diverse groups of terrestrial vertebrates. Recent molecular analyses have suggested a very different squamate phylogeny relative to morphological hypotheses, but many aspects remain uncertain from molecular data. Here, we analyse higher-level squamate phylogeny with a molecular dataset of unprecedented size, including 161 squamate species for up to 44 nuclear genes each (33 717 base pairs), using both concatenated and species-tree methods for the first time. Our results strongly resolve most squamate relationships and reveal some surprising results. In contrast to most other recent studies, we find that dibamids and gekkotans are together the sister group to all other squamates. Remarkably, we find that the distinctive scolecophidians (blind snakes) are paraphyletic with respect to other snakes, suggesting that snakes were primitively burrowers and subsequently re-invaded surface habitats. Finally, we find that some clades remain poorly supported, despite our extensive data. Our analyses show that weakly supported clades are associated with relatively short branches for which individual genes often show conflicting relationships. These latter results have important implications for all studies that attempt to resolve phylogenies with large-scale phylogenomic datasets.},

	abstract = {Recent studies based on different types of data (i.e., morphology, molecules) have found strongly conflicting phylogenies for the genera of iguanid lizards but have been unable to explain the basis for this incongruence. We reanalyze published data from morphology and from the mitochondrial ND4, cytochrome b, 12S, and 16S genes to explore the sources of incongruence and resolve these conflicts. Much of the incongruence centers on the genus Cyclura, which is the sister taxon of Iguana, according to parsimony analyses of the morphology and the ribosomal genes, but is the sister taxon of all other Iguanini, according to the protein-coding genes. Maximum likelihood analyses show that there has been an increase in the rate of nucleotide substitution in Cyclura in the two protein-coding genes (ND4 and cytochrome b), although this increase is not as clear when parsimony is used to estimate branch lengths. Parametric simulations suggest that Cyclura may be misplaced by the protein-coding genes as a result of long-branch attraction; even when Cyclura and Iguana are sister taxa in a simulated phylogeny, Cyclura is still placed as the basal member of the Iguanini by parsimony analysis in 55{\%} of the replicates. A similar long-branch attraction problem may also exist in the morphological data with regard to the placement of Sauromalus with the Gal{\'{a}}pagos iguanas (Amblyrhynchus and Conolophus). The results have many implications for the analysis of diverse data sets, the impact of long branches on parsimony and likelihood methods, and the use of certain protein-coding genes in phylogeny reconstruction.},

	abstract = {I determined whether grouping behavior influences parasite load and body temperature of Galapagos marine iguanas, reptiles that rest gregariously. Mobile (or predatory) Ornithodoros ticks (4.7 mm average body length) approached at a ground speed of 65 cm/min and parasitized sleeping marine iguanas for 3.7 h per night, drawing about 0.1 ml blood. Contagiously transmitted Amblyomma ticks hang on to iguana hosts for days or weeks. Marine iguanas sleeping alone had 2.0 mobile ticks per night, while individuals sleeping in groups had 0.1 to 1.1 mobile ticks per night. Single iguanas decreased their mobile parasite load to 0.2 ticks per night by sleeping on bushes. Experimental nightly translocation of iguanas to areas without other sleeping iguanas significantly increased their mobile parasite burden above levels encountered by naturally single individuals (n = 4.6 ticks per night). Creating an experimental group of two animals reduced infestation with mobile ticks by 59{\%} compared to levels on single animals. Over the course of weeks, mobile ectoparasite loads at grouping sites increased to levels found at single sites, at which point marine iguanas changed sleeping sites. Grouping had no effect on the prevalence of contagious ticks. Furthermore, grouping did not help to conserve body temperature in Genovesa iguanas, as measured by radiotelemetry. I conclude that marine iguanas group during daytime at microhabitats favored for thermoregulation (predation is absent in this population). Thermoregulation was not of prime importance for nightly aggregations, which instead served to reduce mobile ectoparasite load. As a minimum cost of infestation, I estimate that individuals sleeping alone would have a 5.4{\%} lower annual energy budget due to tissue removal, not including potential internal infections.},

Nucleotide sequences of PCR products show that this heteroplasmy is characterized by an 81-bp region which is tandemly repeated five to eight times. Southern blots using PCR products as probes on HaeIII genomic digests confirm the presence of heteroplasmy. Furthermore, densitometry of electrophoresed PCR products from 109 mother-offspring pairs indicate that heteroplasmy is stably transmitted from mother to offspring with one exception: a heteroplasmic offspring had a homoplasmic mother and sib. Nucleotide sequences from this family reveal that a repeat duplication and deletion occurred. The observed mutation rate per generation, $\mu$, for length polymorphism is comparable to an independent estimate, $\mu$ = 10-2, based on hierarchical diversity statistics. With the exception of the repeat nearest the proline tRNA gene, sequence similarities between repeats within bats are consistent with a model of concerted evolution due to unidirectional replication slippage. Selection is inferred to act on the first repeat because in comparison to other repeats it has the least sequence divergence among bats, the fewest transversions, and the lowest minimum free energy associated with folding.},

	abstract = {According to theory, drift load in randomly mating populations is determined by past population size, because enhanced genetic drift in small populations causes accumulation and fixation of recessive deleterious mutations of small effect. In contrast, segregating load due to mutations of low frequency should decline in smaller populations, at least when mutations are highly recessive and strongly deleterious. Strong local selection generally reduces both types of load. We tested these predictions in 13 isolated, outcrossing populations of Arabidopsis lyrata that varied in population size and plant density. Long-term size was estimated by expected heterozygosity at 20 microsatellite loci. Segregating load was assessed by comparing performance of offspring from selfings versus within-population crosses. Drift load was the heterosis effect created by interpopulation outbreeding. Results showed that segregating load was unrelated to long-term size. However, drift load was significantly higher in populations of small effective size and low density. Drift load was mostly expressed late in development, but started as early as germination and accumulated thereafter. The study largely confirms predictions of theory and illustrates that mutation accumulation can be a threat to natural populations.},

	abstract = {Population persistence has been studied in a conservation context to predict the fate of small or declining populations. Persistence models have explored effects on extinction of random demographic and environmental fluctuations, but in the face of directional environmental change they should also integrate factors affecting whether a population can adapt. Here, we examine the population-size dependence of demographic and genetic factors and their likely contributions to extinction time under scenarios of environmental change. Parameter estimates were derived from experimental populations of the rainforest species, Drosophila birchii, held in the lab for 10 generations at census sizes of 20, 100 and 1000, and later exposed to five generations of heat-knockdown selection. Under a model of directional change in the thermal environment, rapid extinction of populations of size 20 was caused by a combination of low growth rate (r) and high stochasticity in r. Populations of 100 had significantly higher reproductive output, lower stochasticity in r and more additive genetic variance (V(A)) than populations of 20, but they were predicted to persist less well than the largest size class. Even populations of 1000 persisted only a few hundred generations under realistic estimates of environmental change because of low V(A) for heat-knockdown resistance. The experimental results document population-size dependence of demographic and adaptability factors. The simulations illustrate a threshold influence of demographic factors on population persistence, while genetic variance has a more elastic impact on persistence under environmental change.},

We estimated the fitness consequences of these processes in offspring of controlled within-population crosses from 13 populations of the self-incompatible, clonal plant Ranunculus reptans. We used allozyme allelic richness as a proxy for long-term population size, which was positively correlated with current population size. Crosses between plants of smaller populations were less likely to be compatible. Inbreeding load, assessed as the slope of the relationship between offspring performance and parental kinship coefficients, was not related to population size, suggesting that deleterious mutations had not been purged from small populations. Offspring from smaller populations were on average more inbred, so inbreeding depression in clonal fitness was higher in small populations. We estimated variation in drift load from the mean fitness of outbred offspring and found enhanced drift load affecting female fertility within small populations. We conclude that self-incompatibility systems do not necessarily prevent small populations from suffering from inbreeding depression and drift load and may exacerbate the challenge of finding suitable mates.},

First, population genetic models indicate that genetic variation and potential response to se- lection should be positively correlated with population size. The empirical support for this prediction is mixed:DNAmarkers usually reveal low heterozygosity in small populations, whereas quantita- tive traits show reduced heritability only in the smallest and most inbred populations. Quantitative variation can even increase in bot- tlenecked populations although this effect seems unlikely to increase the adaptive potential of populations. Second, individuals in small populations have lower fitness owing to environmental stress and ge- netic problems such as inbreeding, which can substantially increase the extinction probability of populations in changing environments. This second reason has not been included in assessments of crit- ical population size assuring evolvability and makes it likely that many small threatened populations have a decreased potential for adaptation.},

	abstract = {Population genetic studies provide insights into the evolutionary processes that influence the distribution of sequence variants within and among wild populations. F(ST) is among the most widely used measures for genetic differentiation and plays a central role in ecological and evolutionary genetic studies. It is commonly thought that large sample sizes are required in order to precisely infer F(ST) and that small sample sizes lead to overestimation of genetic differentiation. Until recently, studies in ecological model organisms incorporated a limited number of genetic markers, but since the emergence of next generation sequencing, the panel size of genetic markers available even in non-reference organisms has rapidly increased. In this study we examine whether a large number of genetic markers can substitute for small sample sizes when estimating F(ST). We tested the behavior of three different estimators that infer F(ST) and that are commonly used in population genetic studies. By simulating populations, we assessed the effects of sample size and the number of markers on the various estimates of genetic differentiation. Furthermore, we tested the effect of ascertainment bias on these estimates. We show that the population sample size can be significantly reduced (as small as n = 4-6) when using an appropriate estimator and a large number of bi-allelic genetic markers (k{\textgreater}1,000). Therefore, conservation genetic studies can now obtain almost the same statistical power as studies performed on model organisms using markers developed with next-generation sequencing.},

	abstract = {Genetic variation is often lower within island populations, however islands may also harbor divergent genetic variation. The likelihood that insular populations are genetically diverse or divergent should be influenced by island size and isolation. We tested this assumption by comparing patterns of genetic variation across all major island song sparrow populations along the Pacific North American coast. Allelic richness was moderately lowered even on islands which are close to large, potential sources. The most significant differences in allelic richness occurred on very small or highly remote islands. Gene diversity was significantly lower only on remote or very small islands. We found that island populations contribute to regional genetic variation through both the amount of genetic var- iation and the uniqueness of that variation. The partitioning of this contribution was associated with the size and iso- lation of the island populations.},

Forward models of the magnetic anomalies accounting for spreading rate variations, ridge jumps, asymmetric spreading, magnetization intensity variations, and bathymetry show excellent agreement with observed anomalies. Spreading rates can be constrained to a common finite rotation history through anomaly 4A with three changes in rates. Rift propagation has played a dominant role in the continuous reorganization of the geometry of the ridge axis. Propagation has been predominantly away from the hotspot, with humps predominantly southward. Propagation rates have ranged from 30 to 120 mm/yr, commonly near 70 mm/yr. Several generalizations are drawn about along-axis variations in magnetization intensities since 8 Ma. -from Authors},

The method also estimates the posterior probability distributions of individual immigrant ancestries, population allele frequencies, population inbreeding coefficients, and other parameters of potential interest. The method is implemented in a computer program that relies on Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to carry out the estimation of posterior probabilities. The program can be used with allozyme, microsatellite, RFLP, SNP, and other kinds of genotype data. We relax several assumptions of early methods for detecting recent immigrants, using genotype data; most significantly, we allow genotype frequencies to deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium proportions within populations. The program is demonstrated by applying it to two recently published microsatellite data sets for populations of the plant species Centaurea corymbosa and the gray wolf species Canis lupus. A computer simulation study suggests that the program can provide highly accurate estimates of migration rates and individual migrant ancestries, given sufficient genetic differentiation among populations and sufficient numbers of marker loci.},

	abstract = {Contrasting views have been put forward that competition intensity should either increase with community standing crop or remain constant. Testing these hypotheses with long-lived plants in natural communities is possible using pattern analysis, involving statistical summaries of the relationships between the total size and distance of nearest neighbors. This approach, however, may produce a spurious negative correlation between competition intensity and standing crop in cases where individual size increases with standing crop. A method for overcoming this problem using data standardization is illustrated using data from 15 stands in a variety of forest types (subalpine woodland, dry forest, warm wet forest, cool wet forest, and near-rainforest) in southeastern Australia. Standing crop, estimated from stand volume, and water availability, estimated from evapotranspiration, varied significantly among forest types. Total size and nearest neighbor distance was measured for 50 pairs of trees in three stands of each forest type. The sum of nearest neighbor sizes increased significantly with interneighbor distance in all forest types, indicating that competition contributed to pattern at all levels of standing crop. The slopes of the regression equations describing these relationships varied significantly among forest types and with evapotranspiration, suggesting that competition intensity varied. This result, however, was shown to be the product of a significant positive correlation between individual size and standing crop. Once this correlation was removed by using standardized measures of tree size, there was no evidence for variation in competition intensity among forest types or with evapotranspiration},

	abstract = {The history of mankind remains one of the most challenging fields of study. However, the emergence of anatomically modern humans has been so recent that only a few genetically informative polymorphisms have accumulated. Here, we show that DNA sequences from Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium that colonizes the stomachs of most humans and is usually transmitted within families, can distinguish between closely related human populations and are superior in this respect to classical human genetic markers. H. pylori from Buddhists and Muslims, the two major ethnic communities in Ladakh (India), differ in their population-genetic structure. Moreover, the prokaryotic diversity is consistent with the Buddhists having arisen from an introgression of Tibetan speakers into an ancient Ladakhi population. H. pylori from Muslims contain a much stronger ancestral Ladakhi component, except for several isolates with an Indo-European signature, probably reflecting genetic flux from the Near East. These signatures in H. pylori sequences are congruent with the recent history of population movements in Ladakh, whereas similar signatures in human microsatellites or mtDNA were only marginally significant. H. pylori sequence analysis has the potential to become an important tool for unraveling short-term genetic changes in human populations.},

@article{Wittmann2018,
	abstract = {It is now widely accepted that genetic processes such as inbreeding depression and loss of genetic variation can increase the extinction risk of small populations. However, it is generally unclear whether extinction risk from genetic causes gradually increases with decreasing population size or whether there is a sharp transition around a specific threshold population size. In the ecological literature, such threshold phenomena are called `strong Allee effects' and they can arise for example from mate limitation in small populations. In this study, we aim to (i) develop a meaningful notion of a `strong genetic Allee effect', (ii) explore whether and under what conditions such an effect can arise from inbreeding depression due to recessive deleterious mutations, and (iii) quantify the interaction of potential genetic Allee effects with the well-known mate-finding Allee effect. We define a strong genetic Allee effect as a genetic process that causes a population's survival probability to be a sigmoid function of its initial size. The inflection point of this function defines the critical population size. To characterize survival-probability curves, we develop and analyse simple stochastic models for the ecology and genetics of small populations. Our results indicate that inbreeding depression can indeed cause a strong genetic Allee effect, but only if individuals carry sufficiently many deleterious mutations (lethal equivalents). Populations suffering from a genetic Allee effect often first grow, then decline as inbreeding depression sets in and then potentially recover as deleterious mutations are purged. Critical population sizes of ecological and genetic Allee effects appear to be often additive, but even superadditive interactions are possible. Many published estimates for the number of lethal equivalents in birds and mammals fall in the parameter range where strong genetic Allee effects are expected. Unfortunately, extinction risk due to genetic Allee effects can easily be underestimated as populations with genetic problems often grow initially, but then crash later. Also interactions between ecological and genetic Allee effects can be strong and should not be neglected when assessing the viability of endangered or introduced populations.},

Fifty-two iguanas, 20 males and 32 females, ranging in size from 11.1- to 51.0-cm snout-to-vent length (SVL), were included in the sample set, with measurements obtained from each eye. No abnormalities were found on ophthalmic examination, with the exception of mild, focal chemosis in one individual and periocular ticks in 52{\%} of iguanas. Tear production was measured using the phenol red thread test, and IOP was measured using the TonoVet rebound tonometer set on the P (undefined species) setting. No significant difference was found between males and females for either measurement. No significant difference was found between right and left eyes for intraocular pressure; however, a significant difference was found between eyes for tear production values. The mean (+/- SD) of IOP in the left and right eyes were 4.77 +/- 1.88 mm Hg and 5.12 +/- 2.52 mm Hg, respectively, with a range of 1-11 mm Hg. The mean (+/- SD) of tear production in the left and right eyes were 10.63 +/- 6.89 mm/15 sec (range 1-28 mm/15 sec) and 12.44 +/- 7.52 mm/15 sec (range 1-23 mm/15 sec), respectively. A positive correlation was found between SVL and all ocular parameters measured.

	abstract = {Inbreeding is unavoidable in small, isolated populations and can cause substantial fitness reductions compared to outbred populations. This loss of fitness has been predicted to elevate extinction risk giving it substantial conservation significance. Inbreeding may result in reduced fitness for two reasons: an increased expression of deleterious recessive alleles (partial dominance hypothesis) or the loss of favourable heterozygote combinations (overdominance hypothesis). Because both these sources of inbreeding depression are dependent upon dominance variance, inbreeding depression is predicted to be greater in life history traits than in morphological traits. In this study we used replicate inbred and control lines of Drosophila simulans to address three questions:1) is inbreeding depression greater in life history than morphological traits? 2) which of the two hypotheses is the major underlying cause of inbreeding depression? 3) does inbreeding elevate population extinction risk? We found that inbreeding depression was significantly greater in life history traits compared to morphological traits, but were unable to find unequivocal support for either the overdominance or partial dominance hypotheses as the genetic basis of inbreeding depression. As predicted, inbred lines had a significantly greater extinction risk.},

	abstract = {We provide a framework for Bayesian coalescent inference from microsatellite data that enables inference of population history parameters averaged over microsatellite mutation models. To achieve this we first implemented a rich family of microsatellite mutation models and related components in the software package BEAST. BEAST is a powerful tool that performs Bayesian MCMC analysis on molecular data to make coalescent and evolutionary inferences. Our implementation permits the application of existing nonparametric methods to microsatellite data. The implemented microsatellite models are based on the replication slippage mechanism and focus on three properties of microsatellite mutation: length dependency of mutation rate, mutational bias toward expansion or contraction, and number of repeat units changed in a single mutation event. We develop a new model that facilitates microsatellite model averaging and Bayesian model selection by transdimensional MCMC. With Bayesian model averaging, the posterior distributions of population history parameters are integrated across a set of microsatellite models and thus account for model uncertainty. Simulated data are used to evaluate our method in terms of accuracy and precision of estimation and also identification of the true mutation model. Finally we apply our method to a red colobus monkey data set as an example.},

@incollection{Wyatt2015,
	abstract = {Chemical senses are probably among the first senses to have evolved and all cellular life forms from bacteria to animals are sensitive to chemical information, whether it comes from potential food, predators, the environment, or other members of the same species. Chemicals from outside the organism that provide information are termed semiochemicals (Figure 1.1). With the chemical senses in place it was perhaps inevitable that chemical communication would evolve. Pheromones are evolved chemical signals between members of the same species. The molecules are emitted by an individual and received by a second individual of the same species, in which they cause a specific reaction, for example, a stereotyped behavior or a developmental process (Wyatt 2010, after Karlson {\&} Luscher 1959). The word pheromone was coined from the Greek pherein, to carry or transfer, and hormon, to excite or stimulate. While Karlson and Luscher (1959) proposed the word after the first pheromone had been identified in an insect, the silk moth Bombyx mori, they suggested the term would apply to chemical signals in all types of animal from crustaceans to fish to terrestrial mammals. Equally, while the silk moth pheromone was a single molecule, pheromones consisting of many molecules together were not excluded. Karlson and Luscher anticipated that different species might share some of the same molecules. No requirement was made for pheromone responses to be innate. I emphasize these points only because some authors writing about mammals raise these as objections to applying the term to mammal pheromones (e.g., Doty 2010; Petrulis 2013). As I argue below, pheromones are found across the animal kingdom and while mammal pheromones are hard to study, we do have many examples that seem robust (see for example Schaal et al. 2003; Schaal,Chapter 17). Even so, criticisms of some claims in the literature are justified. We should also be careful to distinguish phenomena mediated by pheromones from olfactory phenomena that have more to do with differences between individuals' chemical profiles, allowing individuals to be distinguished (see below). As well as pheromones, animals also receive chemical information about the identity of another individual. The receiving animal may learn a signature mixture: a variable chemical mixture (a subset of the molecules given off in an animal's chemical profile) learned as a template by other conspecifics and used to recognize an animal as an individual (e.g., lobsters, mice) or as a member of a particular social group such as a family, clan, or colony (e.g., ants, bees, badgers) (Figures 1.1 and 1.2) (Wyatt 2010, 2014). The signature mixture is the mix of molecules (and likely, their relative ratios) that are learned. The template is the neural representation of the signature mixture stored in the memory of the learner (after van Zweden {\&} d'Ettorre 2010). There are two distinguishing characteristics of signature mixtures: first, a requirement for learning, and second, the variability of the cues learned, allowing other individuals to be distinguished by their different chemical profiles (Wyatt 2014). There are many biological systems where distinguishing between pheromones and learned highly variable signature mixtures can help our understanding. For example, each ant colony has different combinations of molecules, largely cuticular hydrocarbons, which can be learned as signature mixtures allowing ants to discriminate between colony members and noncolony members (Bos {\&} d'Ettorre d'Ettorre 2012). Every queen of the species, however, has the same queen pheromone (Liebig 2010). In the ant Lasius niger, the queen pheromone is the cuticular hydrocarbon 3-methylhentriacontane, missing from worker profiles (Holman et al. 2010). Similarly, explaining a phenomenon such as the Bruce effect in mice (Brennan 2009; Mucignat-Caretta,Chapter 11) is easier if we distinguish between the individually distinct odors of different males and the pheromone(s) that all male mice produce. The female's memory of the signature mixture of the particular male she mated with has the effect of blocking any stimulus from later contact with his male pheromones whereas the stimulus from the same male pheromones of other, unfamiliar males passes through to the hypothalamus, triggering the Bruce effect. Pheromones and the molecules learned as signature mixtures appear in the cloud of molecules that make up the chemical profile of an organism (Figure 1.2). Much of the chemical profile is highly variable from individual to individual. The sources of the molecules in the chemical profile include the animal's own secretions as well as its environment, food, bacteria, and other individuals. It is this complex background that makes identifying pheromones so challenging in many organisms. Semiochemicals can also be significant to individuals from other species and these are termed allelochemicals (Figure 1.1) (Nordlund {\&} Lewis 1976). Broadcast signals can be eavesdropped, as kairomones. Some of the most spectacular examples of using such kairomones come from predatory beetles homing in on the aggregation pheromones released by their prey, bark beetles (Raffa 2001). Eavesdropping can occur across taxa. Nematode-trapping fungi detect the pheromones of their prey nematodes and produce more traps in response (Hsueh et al. 2013). Aggressive chemical mimicry (allomones) can exploit the responses of organisms to their own pheromones (Vereecken {\&} McNeil 2010). For example, most orchids offer no nectar reward but instead, by mimicking the female pheromones of the insect, they attract bee and wasp males to pollinate them. Bolas spiders lure male moths by producing the moths' female sex pheromone. In this introductory chapter, I will touch on many classic systems such as moths, Drosophila, and mice, which are explored in more detail in the other chapters of this book, but I will also take the opportunity to illustrate points with the pheromones of other animal taxa such as nematodes, mollusks, and fish. For this introductory chapter, I have usually chosen recent references that will lead you to the relevant literature. More detail on the topics covered in this chapter can be found in Wyatt (2014).},

@article{Yang1994,
	abstract = {Two approximate methods are proposed for maximum likelihood phylogenetic estimation, which allow variable rates of substitution across nucleotide sites. Three data sets with quite different characteristics were analyzed to examine empirically the performance of these methods. The first, called the ``discrete gamma model,'' uses several categories of rates to approximate the gamma distribution, with equal probability for each category. The mean of each category is used to represent all the rates falling in the category. The performance of this method is found to be quite good, and four such categories appear to be sufficient to produce both an optimum, or near-optimum fit by the model to the data, and also an acceptable approximation to the continuous distribution. The second method, called ``fixed-rates model,'' classifies sites into several classes according to their rates predicted assuming the star tree. Sites in different classes are then assumed to be evolving at these fixed rates when other tree topologies are evaluated. Analyses of the data sets suggest that this method can produce reasonable results, but it seems to share some properties of a least-squares pairwise comparison; for example, interior branch lengths in nonbest trees are often found to be zero. The computational requirements of the two methods are comparable to that of Felsenstein's (1981, J Mol Evol 17:368--376) model, which assumes a single rate for all the sites. {\textcopyright} 1994, Springer-Verlag New York Inc.

	abstract = {Ecological opportunity--through entry into a new environment, the origin of a key innovation or extinction of antagonists--is widely thought to link ecological population dynamics to evolutionary diversification. The population-level processes arising from ecological opportunity are well documented under the concept of ecological release. However, there is little consensus as to how these processes promote phenotypic diversification, rapid speciation and adaptive radiation. We propose that ecological opportunity could promote adaptive radiation by generating specific changes to the selective regimes acting on natural populations, both by relaxing effective stabilizing selection and by creating conditions that ultimately generate diversifying selection. We assess theoretical and empirical evidence for these effects of ecological opportunity and review emerging phylogenetic approaches that attempt to detect the signature of ecological opportunity across geological time. Finally, we evaluate the evidence for the evolutionary effects of ecological opportunity in the diversification of Caribbean Anolis lizards. Some of the processes that could link ecological opportunity to adaptive radiation are well documented, but others remain unsupported. We suggest that more study is required to characterize the form of natural selection acting on natural populations and to better describe the relationship between ecological opportunity and speciation rates.},

@article{Yu2005,
	abstract = {An analysis of the nuclear beta-fibrinogen intron 7 locus from 30 taxa representing 12 placental orders of mammals reveals the enriched occurrences of short interspersed element (SINE) insertion events. Mammalian-wide interspersed repeats (MIRs) are present at orthologous sites of all examined species except those in the order Rodentia. The higher substitution rate in mouse and a rare MIR deletion from rat account for the absence of MIR in the rodents. A minimum of five lineage-specific SINE sequences are also found to have independently inserted into this intron in Carnivora, Artiodactyla and Lagomorpha. In the case of Carnivora, the unique amplification pattern of order-specific CAN SINE provides important evidence for the "pan-carnivore" hypothesis of this repeat element and reveals that the CAN SINE family may still be active today. Particularly interesting is the finding that all identified lineage-specific SINE elements show a strong tendency to insert within or in very close proximity to the preexisting MIRs for their efficient integrations, suggesting that the MIR element is a hot spot for successive insertions of other SINEs. The unexpected MIR excision as a result of a random deletion in the rat intron locus and the non-random site targeting detected by this study indicate that SINEs actually have a greater insertional flexibility and regional specificity than had previously been recognized. Implications for SINE sequence evolution upon and following integration, as well as the fascinating interactions between retroposons and the host genomes are discussed.},

	abstract = {In what types of environments should we expect to find strong inbreeding depression? Previous studies indicate that inbreeding depression, $\delta$, is positively correlated with the stressfulness of the environment in which it is measured. However, it remains unclear why stress, per se, should increase $\delta$. To our knowledge, only "competitive stress" has a logical connection to $\delta$. Through competition for resources, better quality (outbred) individuals make the environment worse for lower quality (inbred) individuals, accentuating the differences between them. For this reason, we expect inbreeding depression to be stronger in environments where the fitness of individuals is more sensitive to the presence of conspecifics (i.e., where fitness is more density dependent). Indeed, some studies suggest a role for competition within environments, but this idea has not been tested in the context of understanding variation in $\delta$ across environments. Using Drosophila melanogaster, we estimated $\delta$ for viability in 22 different environments. These environments were simultaneously characterized for (1) stressfulness and (2) density dependence. Although stress and density dependence are moderately correlated with each other, inbreeding depression is much more strongly correlated with density dependence. These results suggest that mean selection across the genome is stronger in environments where competition is intense, rather than in environments that are stressful for other reasons.},

However, several alternative hypotheses for the function of accompaniment have received little attention. We analysed potential functions of post-copulatory accompaniment in whiptail lizards, Aspidoscelis costata, by comparing 23 accompanied females and 54 unaccompanied females in the field. Male companions closely followed females for 1 to 2 days around ovulation, after which females became unreceptive. Unaccompanied females were in all stages of the reproductive cycle, including 12 nearly-ovulating females. Male companions were aggressive to other males and, on average, won 98.7{\%} of interactions. Only pairs in accompaniment performed consensual copulations (1 to 3 per pair). Solitary males attempted opportunistic copulations but did not selectively target nearly-ovulating females. Male companions attacked rivals attempting opportunistic copulations, but did not copulate in retaliation when attempts were successful. Accompaniment reduced lunges and pursuits from other males on females, but did not reduce opportunistic copulations or predation, or increase foraging opportunities for females. Through accompaniment, males likely (1) copulate repeatedly, (2) swamp rival sperm, (3) inseminate females more and (4) monopolise access to fertile females, whereas females may receive (1) post-copulatory courtship, (2) copulations with high quality males and (3) sufficient sperm for fertilisation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Brill Academic Publishers.},

	abstract = {The System of Management Units for the Conservation of Wildlife (Sistema de Unidades de Manejo para la Conservaci{\'{o}}n de la Vida Silvestre, SUMA), regulated by the Mexican Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, seeks the correct management and sustainable use of wildlife. The main tool used by SUMA is wildlife management units (UMAs) that harbor wildlife for several purposes (e.g., production, education, research, conservation, and exhibition). Ctenosaura pectinata, a threatened Mexican endemic spiny-tailed iguana, is legally managed through UMAs, some of them harboring individuals that were unwanted pets or confiscations of unknown origin. Facilities may become overcrowded, as iguanas cannot be returned to the wild without knowledge of their origins. This may lead to irresponsible or accidental releases of individuals or their captive-born offspring into the wild; a potential source of genetic contamination to local populations. To promote proper management of captive individuals and to evaluate their potential reintroduction into the wild, we created and tested a distribution-wide database to identify the origin of 24 confiscated individuals harbored in two UMAs in M{\'{e}}xico. We compiled mtDNA and microsatellite data derived from previous studies, including 341 individuals from 49 localities. We applied two Bayesian methods for population genetic assignment using the database as a baseline. In several cases, it was possible to narrow down the potential geographic region of origin when considering mtDNA together with the microsatellite data. The database is potentially a useful resource for authorities and conservation organizations.},

	abstract = {While Quaternary climatic changes are considered by some to have been a major factor promoting speciation within the neotropics, others suggest that much of the neotropical species diversity originated before the Pleistocene. Using mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data, we evaluate the relative importance of Pleistocene and pre-Pleistocene events within the evolutionary history of the Mexican iguana Ctenosaura pectinata, and related species. Results support the existence of cryptic lineages with strong mitochondrial divergence ({\textgreater} 4{\%}) among them. Some of these lineages form zones of secondary contact, with one of them hybridizing with C. hemilopha. Evolutionary network analyses reveal the oldest populations of C. pectinata to be those of the northern and southern Mexican coastal regions. Inland and mid-latitudinal coastal populations are younger in age as a consequence of a history of local extinction within these regions followed by re-colonization. Estimated divergence times suggest that C. pectinata originated during the Pliocene, whereas geographically distinct mitochondrial DNA lineages first started to diverge during the Pliocene, with subsequent divergence continuing through the Pleistocene. Our results highlight the influence of both Pliocene and Pleistocene events in shaping the geographical distribution of genetic variation within neotropical lowland organisms. Areas of high genetic diversity in southern Mexico were detected, this finding plus the high levels of genetic diversity within C. pectinata, have implications for the conservation of this threatened species.},

	abstract = {Aim To delimit the distribution of matrilines of the black iguana (Ctenosaura pectinata), detect potential contact zones between them, and test the hypothesis of geographic concordance in the structuring of matrilines with respect to genetic structuring across the nuclear genome. Location Pacific coast of Mexico in the states of Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima, Michoacan in the lowlands adjacent to the western end of the Mexican Volcanic Belt. Methods Tissue samples were obtained every 10-20 km along a transect across the range of three previously described mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) clades of C. pectinata. Iguanas were genotyped with 11 nuclear microsatellites and maternal lineages were inferred based on mtDNA sequences. Geographic structure and geographic concordance between biparentally and maternally inherited markers were analysed with clustering methods, F(ST) and N(ST) indexes as well as haplotype networks. Results Geographic structure was evident for both markers and the existence of contact zones confirmed. Nevertheless, the distribution of nuclear and mtDNA genetic variation is not geographically concordant. Four matrilines exist in the area, whereas only two nuclear clusters occur. A contact zone between nuclear clusters extends along a distance of c. 60 km, and introgression is evident in individuals from several localities. Main conclusions High levels of genetic diversity were detected on the western coast of Mexico. Historical and contemporaneous processes seem to shape the distribution of genetic variation in C. pectinata. There are no evident geographic, environmental or ecological barriers that coincide with genetic subdivisions, and the observed mtDNA structure is likely to be the result of past climatic changes. The less structured distribution of nuclear genetic variation is consistent with the homogenizing effect of male-biased dispersal. Our findings have implications for the taxonomy and conservation strategies for this threatened species, and highlight the fact that geographic analyses of both cytoplasmic and nuclear genetic variation are important for the meaningful inference of evolutionary and demographic histories.},

@article{Ziehe1989,
	abstract = {The effect of the rate of partial self-fertilization and viability selection on the magnitude of inbreeding depression was investigated for the overdominance genetic model. The influence of these factors was determined for populations with equilibrium genotypic frequencies. Inbreeding depression was measured as the normalized disadvantage in mean viability of selfed progeny as compared to outcrossed progeny. When caused by symmetric homozygous disadvantage at a single locus it is shown always to be less than one-third. Moreover, for fixed rates of self-fertilization, its maximum value is found at intermediate levels of homozygous disadvantage. As the rate of self-fertilization increases, inbreeding depression increases and the homozygote viability that results in maximum depression tends toward one-half the heterozygote viability. Symmetric selection against homozygotes at multiple loci can lead to substantially higher values than selection at a single-locus. As the number of independent loci involved increases, inbreeding depression can reach high levels even though the selfing rate is low. Viability distributions for progenies produced from both random mating and self-fertilization were derived for the case of symmetric selection at independently assorting multiple loci. Distributions of viabilities in progenies resulting from mixtures of selfing and outcrossing were shown to be bimodal when inbreeding depression is high.},

	abstract = {Variation in environmental or genetic quality leads to phenotypic variation in condition, but how much variation in fitness is created by this variation in condition? Using Drosophila melanogaster, we manipulated condition via alternative larval diets and then tested several key factors predicted to influence how much variation in fitness results from differences in condition. Specifically, we were interested in whether male and female fitness are affected equally by condition and whether the strength of selection on condition depends on the abundance of key resources limiting the reproductive output of each sex. We measured selection on condition in alternative assay contexts that varied in the abundance of adult food (a key resource for females) or in the abundance of females (a key resource for males). Overall, selection tended to be stronger on males than females. However, selection on males was weakened when the abundance of their key resource (females) was elevated. Increasing the abundance of the key resource for females (live yeast) elevated their reproductive output as expected but did not change the strength of selection in this sex. Instead, this manipulation increased selection on males, suggesting that this environmental factor indirectly affects selection on males via their interaction with females.},

	abstract = {Subspecies are often used in ways that require their evolutionary independence, for example as proxies for units of conservation. Mitochondrial DNA sequence data reveal that 97{\%} of continentally distributed avian subspecies lack the population genetic structure indicative of a distinct evolutionary unit. Subspecies considered threatened or endangered, some of which have been targets of expensive restoration efforts, also generally lack genetic distinctiveness. Although sequence data show that species include 1.9 historically significant units on average, these units are not reflected by current subspecies nomenclature. Yet, it is these unnamed units and not named subspecies that should play a major role in guiding conservation efforts and in identifying biological diversity. Thus, a massive reorganization of classifications is required so that the lowest ranks, be they species or subspecies, reflect evolutionary diversity. Until such reorganization is accomplished, the subspecies rank will continue to hinder progress in taxonomy, evolutionary studies and especially conservation.},

	abstract = {Dispersal and vicariance are often contrasted as competing processes primarily responsible for spatial and temporal patterns of biotic diversity. Recent methods of biogeographical reconstruction recognize the potential of both processes, and the emerging question is about discovering their relative frequencies. Relatively few empirical studies, especially those employing molecular phylogenies that allow a temporal perspective, have attempted to estimate the relative roles of dispersal and vicariance. In this study, the frequencies of vicariance and dispersal were estimated in six lineages of birds that occur mostly in the aridlands of North America. Phylogenetic trees derived from mitochondrial DNA sequence data were compared for towhees (genus Pipilo), gnatcatchers (genus Polioptila), quail (genus Callipepla), warblers (genus Vermivora) and two groups of thrashers (genus Toxostoma). Different area cladograms were obtained depending on how widespread and missing taxa were coded. Nonetheless, no cladogram was obtained for which all lineages were congruent. Although vicariance was the dominant mode of evolution in these birds, approximately 25{\%} of speciation events could have been derived from dispersal across a preexisting barrier. An expanded database is now needed to estimate the relative roles of each process. Applying a molecular clock calibration, nearly all speciation events are of the order of a million or more years old, much older than typically presumed.},

	abstract = {The European protected-area network will cease to be efficient for biodiversity conservation, particularly in the Mediterranean region, if species are driven out of protected areas by climate warming. Yet, no empirical evidence of how climate change influences ecological communities in Mediterranean nature reserves really exists. Here, we examine long-term (1998-2011/2012) and short-term (2011-2012) changes in the butterfly fauna of Dadia National Park (Greece) by revisiting 21 and 18 transects in 2011 and 2012 respectively, that were initially surveyed in 1998. We evaluate the temperature trend for the study area for a 22-year-period (1990-2012) in which all three butterfly surveys are included. We also assess changes in community composition and species richness in butterfly communities using information on (a) species' elevational distributions in Greece and (b) Community Temperature Index (calculated from the average temperature of species' geographical ranges in Europe, weighted by species' abundance per transect and year). Despite the protected status of Dadia NP and the subsequent stability of land use regimes, we found a marked change in butterfly community composition over a 13 year period, concomitant with an increase of annual average temperature of 0.95$\,^{\circ}$C. Our analysis gave no evidence of significant year-to-year (2011-2012) variability in butterfly community composition, suggesting that the community composition change we recorded is likely the consequence of long-term environmental change, such as climate warming. We observe an increased abundance of low-elevation species whereas species mainly occurring at higher elevations in the region declined. The Community Temperature Index was found to increase in all habitats except agricultural areas. If equivalent changes occur in other protected areas and taxonomic groups across Mediterranean Europe, new conservation options and approaches for increasing species' resilience may have to be devised.},
